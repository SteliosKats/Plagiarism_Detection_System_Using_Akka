he successfully led the country through its greatest internal crisis the american civil war preserving the union and ending slavery
as the war was drawing to a close lincoln became the first american president to be assassinated
before his election in 1860 as the first republican president lincoln had been a country lawyer an illinois state legislator a member of the united states house of representatives and twice an unsuccessful candidate for election to the u s
senate

as an outspoken opponent of the expansion of slavery in the united states 1 2 lincoln won the republican party nomination in 1860 and was elected president later that year his tenure in office was occupied primarily with the defeat of the secessionist confederate states of america in the american civil war
he introduced measures that resulted in the abolition of slavery issuing his emancipation proclamation in 1863 and promoting the passage of the thirteenth amendment to the constitution which passed congress before lincoln s death and was ratified by the states later in 1865

lincoln closely supervised the victorious war effort especially the selection of top generals including ulysses s
grant
historians have concluded that he handled the factions of the republican party well bringing leaders of each faction into his cabinet and forcing them to cooperate
lincoln successfully defused the trent affair a war scare with britain in 1861 under his leadership the union took control of the border slave states at the start of the war
additionally he managed his own reelection in the 1864 presidential election

copperheads and other opponents of the war criticized lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue
conversely the radical republicans an abolitionist faction of the republican party criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery
even with these road blocks lincoln successfully rallied public opinion through his rhetoric and speeches his gettysburg address is but one example of this at the close of the war lincoln held a moderate view of reconstruction seeking to speedily reunite the nation through a policy of generous reconciliation
his successor in the white house andrew johnson also wanted reconciliation among white americans but failed to protect the rights of newly freed slaves
lincoln s assassination in 1865 was the first presidential assassination in american history
he has since consistently been ranked by scholars as one of the greatest u s

      <section name="childhood and education" length="3611" id="2">samuel lincoln first american ancestor of abraham worshipped at old ship church hingham massachusetts abraham lincoln was born on february 12 1809 to thomas lincoln and nancy hanks two uneducated farmers in a one room log cabin on the 348 acre 1 4 km2 sinking spring farm in southeast hardin county kentucky now part of larue county making him the first president born west of the appalachians
lincoln s ancestor samuel lincoln 4 had arrived in hingham massachusetts from england in the 17th century but his descendants had gradually moved west from pennsylvania to virginia and then westward to the frontier 5
symbolic log cabin at the abraham lincoln birthplace national historic site for some time thomas lincoln abraham s father had been a respected citizen of the kentucky backcountry
he had purchased the sinking spring farm in december 1808 for $200 cash $2 73 thousand today 6 and assumption of a debt the family belonged to a hardshell baptist church although abraham himself never joined their church or any other church for that matter

in 1816 the lincoln family became impoverished losing their land through court action and was forced to make a new start in perry county indiana 7
lincoln later noted that this move was partly on account of slavery and partly because of difficulties with land deeds in kentucky 8 when lincoln was nine his mother then 34 years old died of milk sickness
soon afterwards his father remarried to sarah bush johnston
lincoln and his stepmother were close he called her mother for the rest of his life but he was increasingly distant from his father 9
in 1830 after more economic and land title difficulties in indiana the family settled on public land 10 in macon county illinois
the following winter was desolate and especially brutal and the family considered moving back to indiana
the following year when his father relocated the family to a new homestead in coles county illinois 22 year old lincoln struck out on his own canoeing down the sangamon river to the village of new salem in sangamon county 11
later that year hired by new salem businessman denton offutt and accompanied by friends he took goods from new salem to new orleans via flatboat on the sangamon illinois and mississippi rivers

lincoln s formal education consisted of about 18 months of schooling but he was largely self educated and an avid reader
he was also a talented local wrestler and skilled with an axe 12 lincoln avoided hunting and fishing because he did not like killing animals even for food 13 at 6 foot 4 inches 1 93 m he was unusually tall as well as strong

lincoln s father thomas lincoln was uneducated and illiterate however he was extremely talented in the art of storytelling and entertaining friends
thomas would regularly host friendly gatherings at his house which would usually consist of thomas telling stories all night causing a hilarious uproar from his audience
stealthily young abraham would stay up and listen to his father telling stories trying to memorize them himself
occasionally when abraham could not understand a certain story or part of one he would repeat it over and over again in his mind until he finally understood
he then would spend countless hours coming up with a way to put the stories into terms his friends could easily understand
the next day abraham would repeat these stories to his friends mimicking his father
this early practice helped prepare abraham for the many important speeches he would have to give late in his life 14</section>
      <section name="marriage and family" length="2234" id="3">further information sexuality of abraham lincoln on november 4 1842 lincoln married mary todd daughter of a prominent slave owning family from kentucky
the couple had four sons robert todd lincoln was born in springfield illinois on august 1 1843 their only child to survive into adulthood young robert attended phillips exeter academy and harvard college

the other lincoln children were born in springfield illinois and died either during childhood or their teen years
edward baker lincoln was born on march 10 1846 and died on february 1 1850 also in springfield william willie wallace lincoln was born on december 21 1850 and died on february 20 1862 in washington d c during president lincoln s first term thomas tad lincoln was born on april 4 1853 and died on july 16 1871 in chicago
lincoln s last undisputed lineal descendant robert todd lincoln beckwith died december 24 1985

lincoln was not lucky when it came to women
having lost his first love ann rutledge to what could possibly have been typhoid fever he courted mary owens the sister of his friend elizabeth abell with the promise of marriage
lincoln finally proposed to owens in may 1837 but the proposal was less than appealing to her
eighteen months after that rejection however lincoln became engaged to mary todd finally in november 1842 after an eighteen month break in their engagement they were married in the parlor of the edwards mansion
eventually after their marriage they settled into a quaint house on eighth and jackson in springfield which was conveniently located within walking distance of his law office
mary had a hard time adjusting to her new life because she was used to having slaves perform most of the chores all of her life also because mary was used to having money her entire life she struggled with the adjustment to relative poverty
even though abraham and mary struggled with the first couple of years of their marriage the births of two sons within the first forty months of their marriage helped relieve some of that tension
the lincolns did not believe in rules and boundaries when it came to their children
they were free and able to do anything they pleased 15</section>
      <section name="early political career and military service" length="1341" id="4">main articles abraham lincoln s early life and career and abraham lincoln in the black hawk war sketch of a younger abraham lincoln lincoln began his political career in 1832 at age 23 with an unsuccessful campaign for the illinois general assembly as a member of the whig party
the centerpiece of his platform was the undertaking of navigational improvements on the sangamon river
later that year he served as a captain in a company of the illinois militia during the black hawk war although he never saw combat

in 1834 he won an election to the state legislature and after coming across the commentaries on the laws of england began to teach himself law
admitted to the bar in 1837 he moved to springfield illinois that same year and began to practice law with john t
stuart
with a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross examinations and in his closing arguments lincoln became an able and successful lawyer 16
in 1841 lincoln entered the law practice with william herndon a fellow whig

he served four successive terms in the illinois house of representatives as a representative from sangamon county and became a leader of the illinois whig party
in 1837 he made his first protest against slavery in the illinois house stating that the institution was founded on both injustice and bad policy 17</section>
      <section name="illinois politics" length="2110" id="5">lincoln in 1846 or 1847 in 1846 lincoln was elected to one term in the u s
house of representatives
a staunch whig lincoln often referred to party leader henry clay as his political idol as a freshman house member lincoln was not a particularly powerful or influential figure in congress he used his office as an opportunity to speak out against the war with mexico which he attributed to president polk s desire for military glory that attractive rainbow that rises in showers of blood
lincoln s most famous stand against polk was in his spot resolutions the war had begun with a violent confrontation on disputed territory claimed by both mexico and texas but polk had insisted that mexican soldiers had invaded our territory shed the blood of our fellow citizens on our own soil 18
lincoln demanded that polk show congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and proof that that spot was on american soil congress never enacted the resolution or even debated it and its introduction resulted in a loss of political support for lincoln in his district one illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him spotty lincoln 19
lincoln was a key early supporter of zachary taylor s candidacy for the 1848 whig presidential nomination
when lincoln s term ended the incoming taylor administration offered him the governorship of remote oregon territory
acceptance would end his career in the fast growing state of illinois so he declined
returning instead to springfield illinois he turned most of his energies to making a living at the bar which involved extensive travel on horseback from county to county

it was during this stage of his life however that lincoln gave one of the most pivotal speeches 20 of his life speaking not as a politician but as a private citizen
opposed to the 1854 kansas nebraska act lincoln spoke to a crowd in peoria illinois on october 16 1854 outlining the moral political and economic arguments against slavery 21 that he would continue to uphold throughout his career
this speech marked his re entry into public life</section>
      <section name="prairie lawyer" length="1901" id="6">by the mid 1850s lincoln faced competing transportation interests both the river barges and the railroads
originally lincoln had favored riverboat interests
in 1849 he had received a patent for a device to buoy vessels over shoals
lincoln s goal had been to lessen the draft of a river craft by pushing horizontal floats into the water alongside the hull the floats would have served as temporary ballast tanks 22 23
the concept was never commercialized
lincoln was the only president of the united states to hold a patent

as the 1850s began lincoln moved closer towards the railroad industry
in 1851 he represented the alton &amp; sangamon railroad in a dispute with one of its shareholders james a barret
barret had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to that corporation on the grounds that it had changed its originally planned route
lincoln argued that as a matter of law a corporation is not bound by its original charter when that charter can be amended in the public interest that the newer proposed alton &amp; sangamon route was superior and less expensive and that accordingly the corporation had a right to sue mr
barret for his delinquent payment
he won this case and the decision by the illinois supreme court was eventually cited by several other courts throughout the united states

lincoln s most notable criminal trial came in 1858 when he defended william duff armstrong who was on trial for the murder of james preston metzker
the case is famous for lincoln s use of judicial notice a rare tactic at that time to show an eyewitness had lied on the stand
after the witness testified to having seen the crime in the moonlight lincoln produced a farmer s almanac to show that the moon on that date was at such a low angle it could not have produced enough illumination to see anything clearly
based upon this evidence armstrong was acquitted</section>
      <section name="republican politics 1854–1860" length="2779" id="7">lincoln returned to politics in response to the kansas nebraska act 1854 which expressly repealed the limits on slavery s extent as established by the missouri compromise 1820
illinois democrat stephen a douglas the most powerful man in the senate proposed popular sovereignty as the solution to the slavery impasse and incorporated it into the kansas–nebraska act
douglas argued that in a democracy the people should have the right to decide whether or not to allow slavery in their territory rather than have such a decision imposed on them by the national congress 24
in the october 16 1854 peoria speech 25 lincoln first stood out among the other free soil orators of the day 26 the act has a declared indifference but as i must think covert real zeal for the spread of slavery i cannot but hate it
i hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself
i hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world enables the enemies of free institutions with plausibility to taunt us as hypocrites causes the real friends of freedom to doubt our sincerity and especially because it forces so many really good men amongst ourselves into an open war with the very fundamental principles of civil liberty criticizing the declaration of independence and insisting that there is no right principle of action but self interest 27
drawing on remnants of the old whig party and on disenchanted free soil liberty and democratic party members he was instrumental in forging the shape of the new republican party
in a stirring campaign the republicans carried illinois in 1854 and elected a senator
lincoln was the obvious choice but to keep the new party balanced he allowed the election to go to an ex democrat lyman trumbull
at the republican convention in 1856 lincoln placed second in the contest to become the party s candidate for vice president

in 1857 58 douglas broke with president buchanan leading to a fight for control of the democratic party
some eastern republicans even favored the reelection of douglas in 1858 since he had led the opposition to the lecompton constitution which would have admitted kansas as a slave state
accepting the republican nomination for senate in 1858 lincoln delivered his famous speech a house divided against itself cannot stand mark 3 25 i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free i do not expect the union to be dissolved i do not expect the house to fall but i do expect it will cease to be divided
it will become all one thing or all the other 28
the speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate and rallied republicans across the north</section>
      <section name="lincoln douglas debates of 1858" length="1047" id="8">main article lincoln douglas debates of 1858 the 1858 campaign featured the lincoln douglas debates a famous contest on slavery
lincoln warned that the slave power was threatening the values of republicanism while stephen douglas emphasized the supremacy of democracy as set forth in his freeport doctrine which said that local settlers should be free to choose whether to allow slavery or not and could overrule judicial rulings
though the republican legislative candidates won more popular votes the democrats won more seats and the legislature reelected douglas to the senate
nevertheless lincoln s speeches on the issue transformed him into a national political star new york party leaders invited him to give a speech at cooper union in february 1860 to an elite audience that was startled by the poorly dressed ugly man from the west he stunned the audience with the most brilliant political speech they had ever heard
lincoln was emerging as the intellectual leader of the republican party and its best speaker 29</section>

main article united states presidential election 1860 lincoln was chosen as the republican candidate for the 1860 election for several reasons
his expressed views on slavery were seen as more moderate than those of rivals william h seward and salmon p chase
his western origins also appealed to the newer states other contenders especially those with more governmental experience had acquired enemies within the party and were weak in the critical western states while lincoln was perceived as a moderate who could win the west most republicans agreed with lincoln that the north was the aggrieved party as the slave power tightened its grasp on the national government
throughout the 1850s he denied that there would ever be a civil war and his supporters repeatedly rejected claims that his election would incite secession 30 need quotation on talk to verify on may 9 10 1860 the illinois republican state convention was held in decatur
at this convention lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency

1860 presidential election results lincoln did not campaign on the road despite this he had gained the majority of the popular vote due to the work of the local republican party offices throughout the north
they produced tons of campaign posters and leaflets and thousands of newspaper editorials
there were thousands of republican speakers who focused first on the party platform and second on lincoln s life story making an emphasis on his childhood poverty
the goal was to emphasize the superior power of free labor whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts
in the south lincoln did not appear on a majority of the ballots come the time of the election

on november 6 1860 lincoln was elected as the 16th president of the united states beating democrat stephen a douglas john c breckinridge of the southern democrats and john bell of the new constitutional union party
he was the first republican president winning entirely on the strength of his support in the north he was not even on the ballot in nine states in the south and won only 2 of 996 counties in all of the southern states
there were fusion tickets in some states but even if his opponents had combined in every state lincoln had a majority vote in all but two of the states in which he won the electoral votes and would still have won the electoral college and the election

      <section name="presidency and the civil war" length="1110" id="10">main articles origins of the american civil war and abraham lincoln and the civil war with the emergence of the republicans as the nation s first major sectional party by the mid 1850s politics became the stage on which sectional tensions were played out
although much of the west – the focal point of sectional tensions – was unfit for cotton cultivation southern secessionists read the political fallout as a sign that their power in national politics was rapidly weakening
before the slave system had been buttressed to an extent by the democratic party which was increasingly seen as representing a more pro southern position that unfairly permitted southerners to prevail in the nation s territories and to dominate national policy before the civil war
but they suffered a significant reverse in the electoral realignment of the mid 1850s
1860 was a critical election that marked a stark change in existing patterns of party loyalties among groups of voters abraham lincoln s election was a watershed in the balance of power of competing national and parochial interests and affiliations</section>
      <section name="secession winter 1860–1861" length="4522" id="11">main articles baltimore plot and cornerstone speech as lincoln s election became more likely secessionists made it clear that their states would leave the union
on december 20 1860 south carolina took the lead by february 1 1861 south carolina was followed by six other cotton growing states in the deep south
the seven states soon declared themselves to be a new nation the confederate states of america
the upper south delaware maryland virginia north carolina tennessee kentucky missouri and arkansas listened to but initially rejected the secessionist appeal
president buchanan and president elect lincoln refused to recognize the confederacy

attempts at compromise such as the crittenden compromise which would have extended the missouri line of 1820 were discussed
despite support for the crittenden compromise among some republicans lincoln denounced it in private letters saying either the missouri line extended or pop sov would lose us everything we gained in the election that filibustering for all south of us and making slave states of it would follow in spite of us under either plan 31 while other republicans publicly stated it would amount to a perpetual covenant of war against every people tribe and state owning a foot of land between here and tierra del fuego 32 president elect lincoln evaded possible assassins in baltimore and on february 23 1861 arrived in disguise in washington d c

a photograph of the march 4 1861 inauguration of abraham lincoln in front of united states capitol at his inauguration on march 4 1861 the german american turners formed lincoln s bodyguard and a sizable garrison of federal troops was also present ready to protect the capital from confederate invasion and local insurrection
in his first inaugural address lincoln declared i hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the constitution the union of these states is perpetual
perpetuity is implied if not expressed in the fundamental law of all national governments arguing further that the purpose of the united states constitution was to form a more perfect union than the articles of confederation which were explicitly perpetual thus the constitution too was perpetual
he asked rhetorically that even were the constitution a simple contract would it not require the agreement of all parties to rescind it also in his inaugural address in a final attempt to reunite the states and prevent the looming war lincoln supported the pending corwin amendment to the constitution which had already passed congress
this amendment which explicitly protected slavery in those states in which it already existed had more appeal to the critical border states than to the states that had already declared their separation

by the time lincoln took office the confederacy was an established fact and no leaders of the insurrection proposed rejoining the union on any terms
no compromise was found because a compromise was deemed virtually impossible
buchanan might have allowed the southern states to secede and some republicans recommended that however conservative democratic nationalists such as jeremiah s
black joseph holt and edwin m
stanton had taken control of buchanan s cabinet around january 1 1861 and refused to accept secession
lincoln and nearly every republican leader adopted this position by march 1861 the union could not be dismantled
believing that a peaceful solution was still possible lincoln decided to not take any action against the south unless the unionists themselves were attacked first
this finally happened in april 1861

historian allan nevins argues that lincoln made three miscalculations in believing that he could preserve the union hold government property and still avoid war
he temporarily underrated the gravity of the crisis overestimated the strength of unionist sentiment in the south and border states and misunderstood the conditional support of unionists in the border states 33
in connection with nevins s conclusions it is interesting to note an incident from this period reported in the memoirs of william tecumseh sherman
then a civilian sherman visited lincoln in the white house during inauguration week with his brother ohio republican john sherman
this meeting left the future general sherman sadly disappointed at lincoln s seeming failure to realize that the country was sleeping on a volcano and the south was preparing for war 34</section>

virginia which had repeatedly warned lincoln that it would not allow an invasion of its territory or join an attack on another state responded by seceding along with north carolina tennessee and arkansas

the slave states of missouri kentucky maryland and delaware did not secede lincoln urgently negotiated with state leaders there promising not to interfere with slavery
after the fighting started he had rebel leaders arrested in all the border areas and held in military prisons without trial
over 18 000 were arrested though none were executed
one clement vallandigham was exiled but all of the remainder were released usually after two or three months see ex parte merryman

      <section name="emancipation proclamation" length="4354" id="13">main articles abraham lincoln on slavery and emancipation proclamation lincoln met with his cabinet on july 22 1862 for the first reading of a draft of the emancipation proclamation

lincoln maintained that the powers of his administration to end slavery were limited by the constitution
he expected to bring about the eventual extinction of slavery by stopping its further expansion into any u s territory and by convincing states to accept compensated emancipation if the state would outlaw slavery an offer that took effect only in washington d c
guelzo says lincoln believed that shrinking slavery in this way would make it uneconomical and place it back on the road to eventual extinction that the founders had envisioned 35
in july 1862 congress passed the second confiscation act which freed the slaves of anyone convicted of aiding the rebellion 36
the goal was to weaken the rebellion which was led and controlled by slave owners
while it did not abolish the legal institution of slavery the thirteenth amendment did that the act showed that lincoln had the support of congress in liberating slaves owned by rebels
in that same month lincoln discussed a draft of the emancipation proclamation with his cabinet

in a shrewdly penned august reply to an editorial by horace greeley in the influential new york tribune with a draft of the proclamation already on lincoln s desk the president subordinated the goal of ending slavery to the cause of preserving the union while at the same time preparing the public for emancipation being incomplete at first
lincoln had decided at this point that he could not win the war without freeing the slaves and so it was a necessity to do more to help the cause 37 i would save the union
i would save it the shortest way under the constitution
the sooner the national authority can be restored the nearer the union will be the union as it was
my paramount object in this struggle is to save the union and is not either to save or to destroy slavery
if i could save the union without freeing any slave i would do it and if i could save it by freeing all the slaves i would do it and if i could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone i would also do that what i do about slavery and the colored race i do because i believe it helps to save the union and what i forbear i forbear because i do not believe it would help to save the union
i shall do less whenever i shall believe what i am doing hurts the cause and i shall do more whenever i shall believe doing more will help the cause
i shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors and i shall adopt new views so fast as they shall appear to be true views
i have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty and i intend no modification of my oft expressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free 38 the emancipation proclamation announced on september 22 1862 and put into effect on january 1 1863 freed slaves in territories not already under union control
as union armies advanced south more slaves were liberated until all of them in confederate territory over three million were freed
lincoln later said i never in my life felt more certain that i was doing right than i do in signing this paper
the proclamation made the abolition of slavery in the rebel states an official war goal lincoln then threw his energies into passage of the thirteenth amendment to permanently abolish slavery throughout the nation 39
in september 1862 thirteen northern governors met in altoona pennsylvania at the loyal war governors conference to discuss the proclamation and union war effort
in the end the state executives fully supported the president s proclamation and also suggested the removal of general george b mcclellan as commander of the union s army of the potomac 40
for some time lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves
he commented favorably on colonization in the emancipation proclamation but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed
as frederick douglass observed lincoln was the first great man that i talked with in the united states freely who in no single instance reminded me of the difference between himself and myself of the difference of color 41</section>
      <section name="gettysburg address" length="2678" id="14">main article gettysburg address although the battle of gettysburg was a union victory it was also the bloodiest battle of the war and dealt a blow to lincoln s war effort
as the union army decreased in numbers due to casualties more soldiers were needed to replace the ranks
lincoln s 1863 military drafts were considered odious among many in the north particularly immigrants
the new york draft riots of july 1863 were the most notable manifestation of this discontent

writing to lincoln in september 1863 the governor of pennsylvania andrew curtin warned that political sentiments were turning against lincoln and the war effort if the election were to occur now the result would be extremely doubtful and although most of our discreet friends are sanguine of the result my impression is the chances would be against us
the draft is very odious in the state the democratic leaders have succeeded in exciting prejudice and passion and have infused their poison into the minds of the people to a very large extent and the changes are against us 42 the gettysburg address is one of the most quoted speeches in united states history 43 44 45
it was delivered at the dedication of the soldiers national cemetery in gettysburg pennsylvania on the afternoon of thursday november 19 1863 during the american civil war four and a half months after the union armies defeated those of the confederacy at the decisive battle of gettysburg

abraham lincoln s carefully crafted address secondary to other presentations that day came to be regarded as one of the greatest speeches in american history
in just over two minutes lincoln invoked the principles of human equality espoused by the declaration of independence and redefined the civil war as a struggle not merely for the union but as a new birth of freedom that would bring true equality to all of its citizens and that would also create a unified nation in which states rights were no longer dominant

beginning with the now iconic phrase four score and seven years ago lincoln referred to the events of the civil war and described the ceremony at gettysburg as an opportunity not only to consecrate the grounds of a cemetery but also to dedicate the living to the struggle to ensure that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth

despite the speech s prominent place in the history and popular culture of the united states the exact wording of the speech is disputed
the five known manuscripts of the gettysburg address differ in a number of details and also differ from contemporary newspaper reprints of the speech</section>

with an election looming he easily defeated efforts to deny his renomination

they ran on the new union party ticket uniting republicans and war democrats

nevertheless republicans across the country feared that lincoln would be defeated
acknowledging this fear lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that if he should lose the election he would still defeat the confederacy before turning over the white house 46 “ this morning as for some days past it seems exceedingly probable that this administration will not be re elected
then it will be my duty to so co operate with the president elect as to save the union between the election and the inauguration as he will have secured his election on such ground that he cannot possibly save it afterwards 47 ” lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet but asked them to sign the sealed envelope

while the democratic platform followed the peace wing of the party and called the war a failure their candidate general george b mcclellan supported the war and repudiated the platform

he won all but three states 48
on march 4 1865 lincoln delivered his second inaugural address his favorite of all his speeches
at this time a victory over the rebels was at hand slavery was dead and lincoln was looking to the future

fondly do we hope fervently do we pray that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away yet if god wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bond man s two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword as was said three thousand years ago so still it must be said the judgments of the lord are true and righteous altogether
with malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right as god gives us to see the right let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nation s wounds to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations 49</section>

september 2008 running the machine an 1864 political cartoon featuring lincoln william fessenden edwin stanton william seward and gideon welles take a swing at the lincoln administration the war was a source of constant frustration for the president and occupied nearly all of his time he had a contentious relationship with general mcclellan who became general in chief of all the union armies in the wake of the embarrassing union defeat at the first battle of bull run and after the retirement of winfield scott in late 1861 despite his inexperience in military affairs lincoln wanted to take an active part in determining war strategy
his priorities were twofold to ensure that washington d c
was well defended and to conduct an aggressive war effort in the hope of ending the war quickly and appeasing the northern public and press
mcclellan a youthful west point graduate and railroad executive called back to active military service took a more cautious approach
he took several months to plan and execute his peninsula campaign with the objective of capturing richmond by moving the army of the potomac by boat to the peninsula between the james and york rivers
mcclellan s delay irritated lincoln as did his insistence that no troops were needed to defend washington d c
lincoln insisted on holding some of mcclellan s troops to defend the capital a decision mcclellan blamed for the ultimate failure of the peninsula campaign

mcclellan a lifelong democrat who was temperamentally conservative was relieved as general in chief after releasing his harrison s landing letter where he offered unsolicited political advice to lincoln urging caution in the war effort
mcclellan s letter incensed radical republicans who successfully pressured lincoln to appoint john pope a republican as head of the new army of virginia
pope complied with lincoln s strategic desire to move toward richmond from the north thus protecting the capital from attack
but pope was soundly defeated at the second battle of bull run in the summer of 1862 forcing the army of the potomac to defend washington for a second time
in response to his failure pope was sent to minnesota to fight the sioux 50
an 1864 mathew brady photo depicts president lincoln reading a book with his youngest son tad panicked by lee s invasion of maryland lincoln restored mcclellan to command of all forces around washington in time for the battle of antietam september 1862
the ensuing union victory enabled lincoln to release his emancipation proclamation but he relieved mcclellan of his command shortly after the 1862 midterm elections and appointed republican ambrose burnside to head the army of the potomac
burnside had promised to follow through on lincoln s strategic vision for a strong offensive against lee and richmond
after burnside was stunningly defeated at fredericksburg joseph hooker was given the command despite his idle talk about the necessity for a military dictator to win the war and a past history of criticizing his commanders 51
hooker was routed by lee at the battle of chancellorsville may 1863 and relieved of command early in the subsequent gettysburg campaign replaced by george meade

after the union victory at gettysburg meade s failure to pursue lee and months of inactivity for the army of the potomac persuaded lincoln to bring in a western general ulysses s
grant
grant already had a solid string of victories in the western theater including the battles of vicksburg and chattanooga
responding to criticism of grant lincoln replied i can t spare this man
he fights 52
grant waged his bloody overland campaign in 1864 with a strategy of a war of attrition characterized by high union losses at battles such as the wilderness and cold harbor but by proportionately higher confederate losses
the high casualty figures alarmed the nation and after grant lost a third of his army lincoln asked what grant s plans were i propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer replied grant
lincoln and the republican party mobilized support throughout the north backed grant to the hilt and replaced his losses 53
the confederacy was out of replacements so lee s army shrank with every battle forcing it back to trenches outside petersburg
in april 1865 lee s army finally crumbled under grant s pounding and richmond fell

lincoln in a top hat with allan pinkerton and major general john alexander mcclernand at antietam lincoln authorized grant to target the confederate infrastructure such as plantations railroads and bridges hoping to destroy the south s morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting
this allowed generals sherman and sheridan to destroy plantations and towns in the shenandoah valley georgia and south carolina
the damage caused by sherman s march to the sea through georgia totaled in excess of $100 million by sherman s own estimate 54
lincoln possessed a keen understanding of strategic points such as the mississippi river and the fortress city of vicksburg and understood the importance of defeating the enemy s army rather than simply capturing cities
he had however limited success in motivating his commanders to adopt his strategies until late 1863 when he found a man who shared his vision of the war in ulysses s
grant
only then could he insist on using african american troops and relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters

throughout the war lincoln showed a keen curiosity with the military campaigns
he spent hours at the war department telegraph office reading dispatches from his generals
he visited battle sites frequently and seemed fascinated by scenes of war
during jubal anderson early s raid on washington d c in 1864 lincoln was watching the combat from an exposed position a captain shouted at him get down you damn fool before you get shot 55</section>
      <section name="reconstruction" length="2570" id="17">main article reconstruction era of the united states reconstruction began during the war as lincoln and his associates pondered questions of how to reintegrate the southern states and what to do with confederate leaders and the freed slaves
lincoln led the moderates regarding reconstruction policy and was usually opposed by the radical republicans under thaddeus stevens in the house and charles sumner and benjamin wade in the senate though he cooperated with these men on most other issues
determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the south lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war in areas behind union lines
his amnesty proclamation of december 8 1863 offered pardons to those who had not held a confederate civil office had not mistreated union prisoners and would sign an oath of allegiance 56
critical decisions had to be made as state after state was reconquered
of special importance were tennessee where lincoln appointed andrew johnson as governor and louisiana where lincoln attempted a plan that would restore statehood when 10 % of the voters agreed to it
the radicals thought this policy too lenient and passed their own plan the wade davis bill in 1864 when lincoln pocket vetoed the bill the radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from louisiana arkansas and tennessee 57 near the end of the war lincoln made an extended visit to grant s headquarters at city point virginia
this allowed the president to confer in person with grant and sherman about ending hostilities as sherman managed a hasty visit to grant from his forces in north carolina at the same time 58 lincoln also was able to visit richmond after it was taken by the union forces and to make a public gesture of sitting at jefferson davis s own desk symbolically saying to the nation that the president of the united states held authority over the entire land he was greeted at the city as a conquering hero by freed slaves whose sentiments were epitomized by one admirer s quote i know i am free for i have seen the face of father abraham and have felt him when a general asked lincoln how the defeated confederates should be treated lincoln replied let em up easy 59 lincoln arrived back in washington on the evening of april 9 1865 the day lee surrendered at appomattox court house in virginia the war was effectively over the other rebel armies surrendered soon after and there was no subsequent guerrilla warfare 60</section>

      <section name="redefining republicanism" length="2294" id="19">the last known high quality photograph of lincoln taken march 1865 lincoln s rhetoric defined the issues of the war for the nation the world and posterity
the gettysburg address defied lincoln s own prediction that the world will little note nor long remember what we say here his second inaugural address is also greatly admired and often quoted

in recent years historians have stressed lincoln s use of and redefinition of republican values
as early as the 1850s a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the constitution lincoln shifted emphasis to the declaration of independence as the foundation of american political values what he called the sheet anchor of republicanism 61
the declaration s emphasis on freedom and equality for all rather than the constitution s tolerance of slavers shifted the debate
as diggins concludes regarding the highly influential cooper union speech lincoln presented americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself 62
his position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism rather than its legalisms 63 64
nevertheless in 1861 lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms the constitution was a contract and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state 65
that duty was also the principle underlying federal intervention in reconstruction

in his gettysburg address lincoln redefined the american nation arguing that it was born not in 1789 but in 1776 conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal
he declared that the sacrifices of battle had rededicated the nation to the propositions of democracy and equality that this nation shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth
by emphasizing the centrality of the nation he rebuffed the claims of state sovereignty
while some critics say lincoln moved too far and too fast they agree that he dedicated the nation to values that marked a new founding of the nation 66</section>

      <section name="domestic measures" length="2915" id="21">lincoln believed in the whig theory of the presidency which left congress to write the laws while he signed them vetoing only those bills that threatened his war powers
thus he signed the homestead act in 1862 making millions of acres of government held land in the west available for purchase at very low cost the morrill land grant colleges act also signed in 1862 provided government grants for agricultural universities in each state
the pacific railway acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the united states first transcontinental railroad which was completed in 1869

other important legislation involved two measures to raise revenues for the federal government tariffs a policy with long precedent and a federal income tax which was new
in 1861 lincoln signed the second and third morrill tariff the first had become law under james buchanan
in 1862 lincoln signed legislation creating the first u s income tax
marginal rates were 3 % on incomes between $600 and $10 000 and 5% on income above $10 000
adjusted for inflation $600 was the equivalent of $12 325 in 2007 us dollars
in 1864 income tax rates were raised to 5% on incomes between $600 and $5 000 7 5% on income between $5 000 and $10 000 and 10 % tax on income above that

lincoln also presided over the creation of the system of national banks by the national banking acts of 1863 1864 and 1865 which allowed the creation of a strong national financial system
congress created and lincoln approved the department of agriculture in 1862 although that institution would not become a cabinet level department until 1889

the legal tender act of 1862 established the united states note the first paper currency in united states history since the continentals that were issued during the revolution
this was done to increase the money supply to pay for fighting the war

during the war lincoln s treasury department effectively controlled all cotton trade in the occupied south the most dramatic incursion of federal controls on the economy

in 1862 lincoln sent a senior general john pope to put down the sioux uprising in minnesota presented with 303 death warrants for convicted santee dakota who were accused of killing innocent farmers lincoln affirmed 39 of these for execution one was later reprieved

abraham lincoln is largely responsible for the institution of the thanksgiving holiday in the united states
prior to lincoln s presidency thanksgiving while a regional holiday in new england since the 17th century had only been proclaimed by the federal government sporadically and on irregular dates
the last such proclamation was during james madison s presidency fifty years before
in 1863 lincoln declared the final thursday in november to be a day of thanksgiving and the holiday has been celebrated annually at that time ever since 68</section>

from left to right henry rathbone clara harris mary todd lincoln abraham lincoln and john wilkes booth originally john wilkes booth a well known actor and a confederate spy from maryland had formulated a plan to kidnap lincoln in exchange for the release of confederate prisoners
after attending an april 11 speech in which lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks an incensed booth changed his plans and determined to assassinate the president 69
learning that the president and first lady would be attending ford s theatre he laid his plans assigning his co conspirators to assassinate vice president andrew johnson and secretary of state william h seward

without his main bodyguard ward hill lamon to whom he related his famous dream regarding his own assassination lincoln left to attend the play our american cousin on april 14 1865 as a lone bodyguard wandered and lincoln sat in his state box box 7 in the balcony booth crept up behind the president and waited for what he thought would be the funniest line of the play you sock dologizing old man trap hoping the laughter would muffle the noise of the gunshot
when the laughter began booth jumped into the box and aimed a single shot round slug 0 44 caliber derringer at his head firing at point blank range
major henry rathbone momentarily grappled with booth but was cut by booth s knife
booth then leaped to the stage and shouted sic semper tyrannis latin thus always to tyrants and escaped despite a broken leg suffered in the leap 70 a twelve day manhunt ensued in which booth was chased by federal agents under the direction of secretary of war edwin m

he was eventually cornered in a virginia barn house and shot dying of his wounds soon after

lincoln s funeral train carried his remains as well as 300 mourners and the casket of his son william 1 654 miles 2 662 km to illinois an army surgeon doctor charles leale initially assessed lincoln s wound as mortal
the president was taken across the street from the theater to the petersen house where he lay in a coma for nine hours before dying
several physicians attended lincoln including u s
army surgeon general joseph k barnes of the army medical museum
using a probe barnes located some fragments of lincoln s skull and the ball lodged 6 inches 15 cm inside his brain
lincoln never regained consciousness and was pronounced dead at 7 22 10 a m
april 15 1865 he was the first president to be assassinated or to lie in state

lincoln s body was carried by train in a grand funeral procession through several states on its way back to illinois 70 while much of the nation mourned him as the savior of the united states copperheads celebrated the death of a man they considered a tyrant

      <section name="religious and philosophical beliefs" length="5027" id="24">further information abraham lincoln and religion in march 1860 in a speech in new haven connecticut lincoln said with respect to slavery “whenever this question shall be settled it must be settled on some philosophical basis
no policy that does not rest upon some philosophical public opinion can be permanently maintained
the philosophical basis for lincoln’s beliefs regarding slavery and other issues of the day require that lincoln be examined seriously as a man of ideas
lincoln was a strong supporter of the american whig version of liberal capitalism who more than most politicians of the time was able to express his ideas within the context of nineteenth century religious beliefs 71
there were few people who strongly or directly influenced lincoln’s moral and intellectual development and perspectives
there was no teacher mentor church leader community leader or peer that lincoln would credit in later years as a strong influence on his intellectual development
lacking a formal education lincoln’s personal philosophy was shaped by an amazingly retentive memory and a passion for reading and learning
it was lincoln’s reading rather than his relationships that were most influential in shaping his personal beliefs 72 73
lincoln did even as a boy largely reject organized religion but the calvinistic doctrine of necessity would remain a factor throughout his life
in 1846 lincoln described the effect of this doctrine as that the human mind is impelled to action or held in rest by some power over which the mind itself has no control 74
in april 1864 in justifying his actions in regard to emancipation lincoln wrote i claim not to have controlled events but confess plainly that events have controlled me
now at the end of three years struggle the nation s condition is not what either party or any man devised or expected
god alone can claim it 75 as lincoln matured and especially during his term as president the idea of a divine will somehow interacting with human affairs more and more influenced his public expressions
on a personal level the death of his son willie in february 1862 may have caused lincoln to look towards religion for answers and solace 76
after willie’s death in the summer or early fall of 1862 lincoln attempted to put on paper his private musings on why from a divine standpoint the severity of the war was necessary the will of god prevails
in great contests each party claims to act in accordance with the will of god both may be and one must be wrong
god cannot be for and against the same thing at the same time
in the present civil war it is quite possible that god s purpose is something different from the purpose of either party and yet the human instrumentalities working just as they do are of the best adaptation to effect his purpose
i am almost ready to say this is probably true that god wills this contest and wills that it shall not end yet
by his mere quiet power on the minds of the now contestants he could have either saved or destroyed the union without a human contest
yet the contest began
and having begun he could give the final victory to either side any day
yet the contest proceeds 77
lincoln’s religious skepticism was fueled by his exposure to the ideas of the lockean enlightenment and classical liberalism especially economic liberalism 72
consistent with the common practice of the whig party lincoln would often use the declaration of independence as the philosophical and moral expression of these two philosophies 78
in a february 22 1861 speech at independence hall in philadelphia lincoln said i have never had a feeling politically that did not spring from the sentiments embodied in the declaration of independence
it was not the mere matter of the separation of the colonies from the motherland but that sentiment in the declaration of independence which gave liberty not alone to the people of this country but i hope to the world for all future time it was that which gave promise that in due time the weight would be lifted from the shoulders of all men
this is a sentiment embodied in the declaration of independence 79 he found in the declaration justification for whig economic policy and opposition to territorial expansion and the nativist platform of the know nothings
in claiming that all men were created free lincoln and the whigs argued that this freedom required economic advancement expanded education territory to grow and the ability of the nation to absorb the growing immigrant population 80
it was the declaration of independence rather than the bible that lincoln most relied on in order to oppose any further territorial expansion of slavery
he saw the declaration as more than a political document
to him as well as to many abolitionists and other antislavery leaders it was foremost a moral document that had forever determined valuable criteria in shaping the future of the nation 81</section>
      <section name="medical history and melancholy" length="3833" id="25">illnesses included frostbitten feet malaria physical trauma and smallpox 82
claims that lincoln had syphilis about 1835 have been controversial but a recent analysis finds them credible 83
despite having multiple illnesses in his life his health up until middle age was not particularly poor for his day 84 as a child lincoln was tall for his age
he reached his adult height of 6 feet 4 inches 1 93 m no later than age 21
friends noticed his arms legs hands and feet were long although well muscled as a young adult he was always thin fragmentary evidence says he weighed over 200 pounds in his mid 20s but his official weight upon his taking office as president was 180 pounds and he is believed to have weighed even less further along in his presidency
based on lincoln s unusual physical appearance dr abraham gordon proposed in 1962 that lincoln had marfan syndrome 85
lincoln s unremarkable cardiovascular history and his normal visual acuity have been the chief objections to the theory and today the diagnosis is considered unlikely 86
testing lincoln s dna for marfan syndrome was contemplated in the 1990s but such a test was not performed

in 2007 dr john sotos proposed that lincoln had multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2b men2b 87
this theory suggests lincoln had all the major features of the disease a marfan like body shape large bumpy lips constipation hypotonia a history compatible with cancer and a family history of the disorder his sons eddie willie and tad and probably his mother
the mole on lincoln s right cheek the asymmetry of his face his large jaw his drooping eyelid and pseudo depression are also suggested as manifestations of men2b
lincoln s longevity is the principal challenge to the men2b theory which could be proven by dna testing
sotos and medical historian jacob appel have recently campaigned to have such testing conducted on a pillowcase stained with lincoln s blood that is owned by the grand army of the republic civil war museum and library in philadelphia an effort that has generated considerable debate among privacy advocates 88
lincoln was regularly reported to suffer from melancholy
some biographers have controversially diagnosed him with clinical depression and bipolar disorder but these theories have generally been dismissed 89
mainly his reported melancholy affected at times of great political stress or warfare and after losing a loved one neither of which are unusual
he lost the two women his mother and his sister he loved very much when he was extremely young
this melancholy was also reinforced later in his life by the losses of his stepmother and his very first love ann rutledge
mary lincoln felt her husband to be too trusting and his melancholy also struck at times he was betrayed or unsupported by those he put faith in 90 other people have suggested that he was simply a private person who took solace in solitude
they argue that this can be seen in some of his actions as both a young boy and adult
some of these actions included withdrawing himself from a crowd to read when he was a little boy and even retreating to his privacy to find a solution to a problem
as an adult lincoln would often slip into depression and emerge a short time later full of humor and happiness
some people suggest that lincoln s humor was actually a healthy way to cope with his depression 91
unlike the quiet deep voice later used by impersonators and actors lincoln reportedly had a strikingly high pitched speaking voice which aided him at times when he needed to be heard by crowds of thousands before the existence of microphones
despite his legendary talent as orator he was said to have been shy and awkward in intimate social situations especially in his youth</section>

he successfully led the country through its greatest internal crisis the american civil war preserving the union and ending slavery
as the war was drawing to a close lincoln became the first american president to be assassinated
before his election in 1860 as the first republican president lincoln had been a country lawyer an illinois state legislator a member of the united states house of representatives and twice an unsuccessful candidate for election to the u s
senate

as an outspoken opponent of the expansion of slavery in the united states 1 2 lincoln won the republican party nomination in 1860 and was elected president later that year his tenure in office was occupied primarily with the defeat of the secessionist confederate states of america in the american civil war
he introduced measures that resulted in the abolition of slavery issuing his emancipation proclamation in 1863 and promoting the passage of the thirteenth amendment to the constitution which passed congress before lincoln s death and was ratified by the states later in 1865

lincoln closely supervised the victorious war effort especially the selection of top generals including ulysses s
grant
historians have concluded that he handled the factions of the republican party well bringing leaders of each faction into his cabinet and forcing them to cooperate
lincoln successfully defused the trent affair a war scare with britain in 1861 under his leadership the union took control of the border slave states at the start of the war
additionally he managed his own reelection in the 1864 presidential election

copperheads and other opponents of the war criticized lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue
conversely the radical republicans an abolitionist faction of the republican party criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery
even with these road blocks lincoln successfully rallied public opinion through his rhetoric and speeches his gettysburg address is but one example of this at the close of the war lincoln held a moderate view of reconstruction seeking to speedily reunite the nation through a policy of generous reconciliation
his successor in the white house andrew johnson also wanted reconciliation among white americans but failed to protect the rights of newly freed slaves
lincoln s assassination in 1865 was the first presidential assassination in u s history
he has since consistently been ranked by scholars as one of the greatest u s

lincoln s ancestor samuel lincoln 4 had arrived in hingham massachusetts from england in the 17th century but his descendants had gradually moved west from pennsylvania to virginia and then westward to the frontier 5
symbolic log cabin at the abraham lincoln birthplace national historic site for some time thomas lincoln abraham s father had been a respected citizen of the kentucky backcountry
he had purchased the sinking spring farm in december 1808 for $200 cash $2 73 thousand today 6 and assumption of a debt the family belonged to a hardshell baptist church although abraham himself never joined their church or any other church for that matter

in 1816 the lincoln family became impoverished losing their land through court action and was forced to make a new start in perry county indiana 7
lincoln later noted that this move was partly on account of slavery and partly because of difficulties with land deeds in kentucky 8 when lincoln was nine his mother then 34 years old died of milk sickness
soon afterwards his father remarried to sarah bush johnston
lincoln and his stepmother were close he called her mother for the rest of his life but he was increasingly distant from his father 9
in 1830 after more economic and land title difficulties in indiana the family settled on public land 10 in macon county illinois
the following winter was desolate and especially brutal and the family considered moving back to indiana
the following year when his father relocated the family to a new homestead in coles county illinois 22 year old lincoln struck out on his own canoeing down the sangamon river to the village of new salem in sangamon county 11
later that year hired by new salem businessman denton offutt and accompanied by friends he took goods from new salem to new orleans via flatboat on the sangamon illinois and mississippi rivers

lincoln s formal education consisted of about 18 months of schooling but he was largely self educated and an avid reader
he was also a talented local wrestler and skilled with an axe 12 lincoln avoided hunting and fishing because he did not like killing animals even for food 13 at 6 foot 4 inches 1 93 m he was unusually tall as well as strong

lincoln s father thomas lincoln was uneducated and illiterate however he was extremely talented in the art of storytelling and entertaining friends
thomas would regularly host friendly gatherings at his house which would usually consist of thomas telling stories all night causing a hilarious uproar from his audience
stealthily young abraham would stay up and listen to his father telling stories trying to memorize them himself
occasionally when abraham could not understand a certain story or part of one he would repeat it over and over again in his mind until he finally understood
he then would spend countless hours coming up with a way to put the stories into terms his friends could easily understand
the next day abraham would repeat these stories to his friends mimicking his father
this early practice helped prepare abraham for the many important speeches he would have to give late in his life 14</section>
      <section name="marriage and family" length="2234" id="3">further information sexuality of abraham lincoln on november 4 1842 lincoln married mary todd daughter of a prominent slave owning family from kentucky
the couple had four sons robert todd lincoln was born in springfield illinois on august 1 1843 their only child to survive into adulthood young robert attended phillips exeter academy and harvard college

the other lincoln children were born in springfield illinois and died either during childhood or their teen years
edward baker lincoln was born on march 10 1846 and died on february 1 1850 also in springfield william willie wallace lincoln was born on december 21 1850 and died on february 20 1862 in washington d c during president lincoln s first term thomas tad lincoln was born on april 4 1853 and died on july 16 1871 in chicago
lincoln s last undisputed lineal descendant robert todd lincoln beckwith died december 24 1985

lincoln was not lucky when it came to women
having lost his first love ann rutledge to what could possibly have been typhoid fever he courted mary owens the sister of his friend elizabeth abell with the promise of marriage
lincoln finally proposed to owens in may 1837 but the proposal was less than appealing to her
eighteen months after that rejection however lincoln became engaged to mary todd finally in november 1842 after an eighteen month break in their engagement they were married in the parlor of the edwards mansion
eventually after their marriage they settled into a quaint house on eighth and jackson in springfield which was conveniently located within walking distance of his law office
mary had a hard time adjusting to her new life because she was used to having slaves perform most of the chores all of her life also because mary was used to having money her entire life she struggled with the adjustment to relative poverty
even though abraham and mary struggled with the first couple of years of their marriage the births of two sons within the first forty months of their marriage helped relieve some of that tension
the lincolns did not believe in rules and boundaries when it came to their children
they were free and able to do anything they pleased 15</section>

the centerpiece of his platform was the undertaking of navigational improvements on the sangamon river
later that year he served as a captain in a company of the illinois militia during the black hawk war although he never saw combat

in 1834 he won an election to the state legislature and after coming across the commentaries on the laws of england began to teach himself law
admitted to the bar in 1837 he moved to springfield illinois that same year and began to practice law with john t
stuart
with a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross examinations and in his closing arguments lincoln became an able and successful lawyer 16
in 1841 lincoln entered the law practice with william herndon a fellow whig

he served four successive terms in the illinois house of representatives as a representative from sangamon county and became a leader of the illinois whig party
in 1837 he made his first protest against slavery in the illinois house stating that the institution was founded on both injustice and bad policy 17</section>
      <section name="illinois politics" length="2108" id="5">lincoln in 1846 or 1847 in 1846 lincoln was elected to one term in the u s
house of representatives
a staunch whig lincoln often referred to party leader henry clay as his political idol as a freshman house member lincoln was not a particularly powerful or influential figure in congress he used his office as an opportunity to speak out against the war with mexico which he attributed to president polk s desire for military glory that attractive rainbow that rises in showers of blood
lincoln s most famous stand against polk was in his spot resolutions the war had begun with a violent confrontation on disputed territory claimed by both mexico and texas but polk had insisted that mexican soldiers had invaded our territory shed the blood of our fellow citizens on our own soil 18
lincoln demanded that polk show congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and proof that that spot was on american soil congress never enacted the resolution or even debated it and its introduction resulted in a loss of political support for lincoln in his district one illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him spotty lincoln 19
lincoln was a key early supporter of zachary taylor s candidacy for the 1848 whig presidential nomination
when lincoln s term ended the incoming taylor administration offered him the governorship of remote oregon territory
acceptance would end his career in the fast growing state of illinois so he declined
returning instead to springfield illinois he turned most of his energies to making a living at the bar which involved extensive travel on horseback from county to county

it was during this stage of his life however that lincoln gave one of the most pivotal speeches 2 of his life speaking not as a politician but as a private citizen
opposed to the 1854 kansas nebraska act lincoln spoke to a crowd in peoria illinois on october 16 1854 outlining the moral political and economic arguments against slavery 3 that he would continue to uphold throughout his career
this speech marked his re entry into public life</section>
      <section name="prairie lawyer" length="1901" id="6">by the mid 1850s lincoln faced competing transportation interests both the river barges and the railroads
originally lincoln had favored riverboat interests
in 1849 he had received a patent for a device to buoy vessels over shoals
lincoln s goal had been to lessen the draft of a river craft by pushing horizontal floats into the water alongside the hull the floats would have served as temporary ballast tanks 20 21
the concept was never commercialized
lincoln was the only president of the united states to hold a patent

as the 1850s began lincoln moved closer towards the railroad industry
in 1851 he represented the alton &amp; sangamon railroad in a dispute with one of its shareholders james a barret
barret had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to that corporation on the grounds that it had changed its originally planned route
lincoln argued that as a matter of law a corporation is not bound by its original charter when that charter can be amended in the public interest that the newer proposed alton &amp; sangamon route was superior and less expensive and that accordingly the corporation had a right to sue mr
barret for his delinquent payment
he won this case and the decision by the illinois supreme court was eventually cited by several other courts throughout the united states

lincoln s most notable criminal trial came in 1858 when he defended william duff armstrong who was on trial for the murder of james preston metzker
the case is famous for lincoln s use of judicial notice a rare tactic at that time to show an eyewitness had lied on the stand
after the witness testified to having seen the crime in the moonlight lincoln produced a farmer s almanac to show that the moon on that date was at such a low angle it could not have produced enough illumination to see anything clearly
based upon this evidence armstrong was acquitted</section>
      <section name="republican politics 1854–1860" length="2719" id="7">lincoln returned to politics in response to the kansas nebraska act 1854 which expressly repealed the limits on slavery s extent as determined by the missouri compromise 1820
illinois democrat stephen a douglas the most powerful man in the senate proposed popular sovereignty as the solution to the slavery impasse and incorporated it into the kansas–nebraska act
douglas argued that in a democracy the people should have the right to decide whether or not to allow slavery in their territory rather than have such a decision imposed on them by congress 22
in the october 16 1854 peoria speech 23 lincoln first stood out among the other free soil orators of the day 24 the act has a declared indifference but as i must think covert real zeal for the spread of slavery i cannot but hate it
i hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself
i hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world enables the enemies of free institutions with plausibility to taunt us as hypocrites causes the real friends of freedom to doubt our sincerity and especially because it forces so many really good men amongst ourselves into an open war with the very fundamental principles of civil liberty criticizing the declaration of independence and insisting that there is no right principle of action but self interest 25
drawing on remnants of the old whig free soil liberty and democratic parties he was instrumental in forming the new republican party
in a stirring campaign the republicans carried illinois in 1854 and elected a senator
lincoln was the obvious choice but to keep the new party balanced he allowed the election to go to an ex democrat lyman trumbull
at the republican convention in 1856 lincoln placed second in the contest to become the party s candidate for vice president

in 1857 58 douglas broke with president buchanan leading to a fight for control of the democratic party
some eastern republicans even favored the reelection of douglas in 1858 since he had led the opposition to the lecompton constitution which would have admitted kansas as a slave state
accepting the republican nomination for senate in 1858 lincoln delivered his famous speech a house divided against itself cannot stand mark 3 25 i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free i do not expect the union to be dissolved i do not expect the house to fall but i do expect it will cease to be divided
it will become all one thing or all the other 26
the speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate and rallied republicans across the north</section>
      <section name="lincoln douglas debates of 1858" length="1047" id="8">main article lincoln douglas debates of 1858 the 1858 campaign featured the lincoln douglas debates a famous contest on slavery
lincoln warned that the slave power was threatening the values of republicanism while stephen douglas emphasized the supremacy of democracy as set forth in his freeport doctrine which said that local settlers should be free to choose whether to allow slavery or not and could overrule judicial rulings
though the republican legislative candidates won more popular votes the democrats won more seats and the legislature reelected douglas to the senate
nevertheless lincoln s speeches on the issue transformed him into a national political star new york party leaders invited him to give a speech at cooper union in february 1860 to an elite audience that was startled by the poorly dressed ugly man from the west he stunned the audience with the most brilliant political speech they had ever heard

main article united states presidential election 1860 lincoln was chosen as the republican candidate for the 1860 election for several reasons
his expressed views on slavery were seen as more moderate than those of rivals william h seward and salmon p chase
his western origins also appealed to the newer states other contenders especially those with more governmental experience had acquired enemies within the party and were weak in the critical western states while lincoln was perceived as a moderate who could win the west most republicans agreed with lincoln that the north was the aggrieved party as the slave power tightened its grasp on the national government
throughout the 1850s he denied that there would ever be a civil war and his supporters repeatedly rejected claims that his election would incite secession 28 need quotation on talk to verify on may 9 10 1860 the illinois republican state convention was held in decatur
at this convention lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency

1860 presidential election results lincoln did not campaign on the road despite this he had gained the majority of the popular vote due to the work of the local republican party offices throughout the north
they produced tons of campaign posters and leaflets and thousands of newspaper editorials
there were thousands of republican speakers who focused first on the party platform and second on lincoln s life story making an emphasis on his childhood poverty
the goal was to emphasize the superior power of free labor whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts
in the south lincoln did not appear on a majority of the ballots come the time of the election

on november 6 1860 lincoln was elected as the 16th president of the united states beating democrat stephen a douglas john c breckinridge of the southern democrats and john bell of the new constitutional union party
he was the first republican president winning entirely on the strength of his support in the north he was not even on the ballot in nine states in the south and won only 2 of 996 counties in all of the southern states
there were fusion tickets in some states but even if his opponents had combined in every state lincoln had a majority vote in all but two of the states in which he won the electoral votes and would still have won the electoral college and the election

although much of the west – the focal point of sectional tensions – was unfit for cotton cultivation southern secessionists read the political fallout as a sign that their power in national politics was rapidly weakening
before the slave system had been buttressed to an extent by the democratic party which was increasingly seen as representing a more pro southern position that unfairly permitted southerners to prevail in the nation s territories and to dominate national policy before the civil war
but they suffered a significant reverse in the electoral realignment of the mid 1850s

on december 20 1860 south carolina took the lead by february 1 1861 south carolina was followed by six other cotton growing states in the deep south
the seven states soon declared themselves to be a new nation the confederate states of america
the upper south delaware maryland virginia north carolina tennessee kentucky missouri and arkansas listened to but initially rejected the secessionist appeal
president buchanan and president elect lincoln refused to recognize the confederacy

attempts at compromise such as the crittenden compromise which would have extended the missouri line of 1820 were discussed
despite support for the crittenden compromise among some republicans lincoln denounced it in private letters saying either the missouri line extended or pop sov would lose us everything we gained in the election that filibustering for all south of us and making slave states of it would follow in spite of us under either plan 29 while other republicans publicly stated it would amount to a perpetual covenant of war against every people tribe and state owning a foot of land between here and tierra del fuego 30 president elect lincoln evaded possible assassins in baltimore and on february 23 1861 arrived in disguise in washington d c

a photograph of the march 4 1861 inauguration of abraham lincoln in front of united states capitol at his inauguration on march 4 1861 the german american turners formed lincoln s bodyguard and a sizable garrison of federal troops was also present ready to protect the capital from confederate invasion and local insurrection
in his first inaugural address lincoln declared i hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the constitution the union of these states is perpetual
perpetuity is implied if not expressed in the fundamental law of all national governments arguing further that the purpose of the united states constitution was to form a more perfect union than the articles of confederation which were explicitly perpetual thus the constitution too was perpetual
he asked rhetorically that even were the constitution a simple contract would it not require the agreement of all parties to rescind it also in his inaugural address in a final attempt to reunite the states and prevent the looming war lincoln supported the pending corwin amendment to the constitution which had already passed congress
this amendment which explicitly protected slavery in those states in which it already existed had more appeal to the critical border states than to the states that had already declared their separation

by the time lincoln took office the confederacy was an established fact and no leaders of the insurrection proposed rejoining the union on any terms
no compromise was found because a compromise was deemed virtually impossible
buchanan might have allowed the southern states to secede and some republicans recommended that however conservative democratic nationalists such as jeremiah s
black joseph holt and edwin m
stanton had taken control of buchanan s cabinet around january 1 1861 and refused to accept secession
lincoln and nearly every republican leader adopted this position by march 1861 the union could not be dismantled
believing that a peaceful solution was still possible lincoln decided to not take any action against the south unless the unionists themselves were attacked first
this finally happened in april 1861

historian allan nevins argues that lincoln made three miscalculations in believing that he could preserve the union hold government property and still avoid war
he temporarily underrated the gravity of the crisis overestimated the strength of unionist sentiment in the south and border states and misunderstood the conditional support of unionists in the border states 31
in connection with nevins s conclusions it is interesting to note an incident from this period reported in the memoirs of william tecumseh sherman
then a civilian sherman visited lincoln in the white house during inauguration week with his brother ohio republican john sherman
this meeting left the future general sherman sadly disappointed at lincoln s seeming failure to realize that the country was sleeping on a volcano and the south was preparing for war 32</section>

virginia which had repeatedly warned lincoln that it would not allow an invasion of its territory or join an attack on another state responded by seceding along with north carolina tennessee and arkansas

the slave states of missouri kentucky maryland and delaware did not secede lincoln urgently negotiated with state leaders there promising not to interfere with slavery
after the fighting started he had rebel leaders arrested in all the border areas and held in military prisons without trial
over 18 000 were arrested though none were executed

      <section name="emancipation proclamation" length="4354" id="13">main articles abraham lincoln on slavery and emancipation proclamation lincoln met with his cabinet on july 22 1862 for the first reading of a draft of the emancipation proclamation

lincoln maintained that the powers of his administration to end slavery were limited by the constitution
he expected to bring about the eventual extinction of slavery by stopping its further expansion into any u s territory and by convincing states to accept compensated emancipation if the state would outlaw slavery an offer that took effect only in washington d c
guelzo says lincoln believed that shrinking slavery in this way would make it uneconomical and place it back on the road to eventual extinction that the founders had envisioned 33
in july 1862 congress passed the second confiscation act which freed the slaves of anyone convicted of aiding the rebellion 34
the goal was to weaken the rebellion which was led and controlled by slave owners
while it did not abolish the legal institution of slavery the thirteenth amendment did that the act showed that lincoln had the support of congress in liberating slaves owned by rebels
in that same month lincoln discussed a draft of the emancipation proclamation with his cabinet

in a shrewdly penned august reply to an editorial by horace greeley in the influential new york tribune with a draft of the proclamation already on lincoln s desk the president subordinated the goal of ending slavery to the cause of preserving the union while at the same time preparing the public for emancipation being incomplete at first
lincoln had decided at this point that he could not win the war without freeing the slaves and so it was a necessity to do more to help the cause 35 i would save the union
i would save it the shortest way under the constitution
the sooner the national authority can be restored the nearer the union will be the union as it was
my paramount object in this struggle is to save the union and is not either to save or to destroy slavery
if i could save the union without freeing any slave i would do it and if i could save it by freeing all the slaves i would do it and if i could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone i would also do that what i do about slavery and the colored race i do because i believe it helps to save the union and what i forbear i forbear because i do not believe it would help to save the union
i shall do less whenever i shall believe what i am doing hurts the cause and i shall do more whenever i shall believe doing more will help the cause
i shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors and i shall adopt new views so fast as they shall appear to be true views
i have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty and i intend no modification of my oft expressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free 36 the emancipation proclamation announced on september 22 1862 and put into effect on january 1 1863 freed slaves in territories not already under union control
as union armies advanced south more slaves were liberated until all of them in confederate territory over three million were freed
lincoln later said i never in my life felt more certain that i was doing right than i do in signing this paper
the proclamation made the abolition of slavery in the rebel states an official war goal lincoln then threw his energies into passage of the thirteenth amendment to permanently abolish slavery throughout the nation 37
in september 1862 thirteen northern governors met in altoona pennsylvania at the loyal war governors conference to discuss the proclamation and union war effort
in the end the state executives fully supported the president s proclamation and also suggested the removal of general george b mcclellan as commander of the union s army of the potomac 38
for some time lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves
he commented favorably on colonization in the emancipation proclamation but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed
as frederick douglass observed lincoln was the first great man that i talked with in the united states freely who in no single instance reminded me of the difference between himself and myself of the difference of color 39</section>
      <section name="gettysburg address" length="2678" id="14">main article gettysburg address although the battle of gettysburg was a union victory it was also the bloodiest battle of the war and dealt a blow to lincoln s war effort
as the union army decreased in numbers due to casualties more soldiers were needed to replace the ranks
lincoln s 1863 military drafts were considered odious among many in the north particularly immigrants
the new york draft riots of july 1863 were the most notable manifestation of this discontent

writing to lincoln in september 1863 the governor of pennsylvania andrew curtin warned that political sentiments were turning against lincoln and the war effort if the election were to occur now the result would be extremely doubtful and although most of our discreet friends are sanguine of the result my impression is the chances would be against us
the draft is very odious in the state the democratic leaders have succeeded in exciting prejudice and passion and have infused their poison into the minds of the people to a very large extent and the changes are against us 40 the gettysburg address is one of the most quoted speeches in united states history 41 42 43
it was delivered at the dedication of the soldiers national cemetery in gettysburg pennsylvania on the afternoon of thursday november 19 1863 during the american civil war four and a half months after the union armies defeated those of the confederacy at the decisive battle of gettysburg

abraham lincoln s carefully crafted address secondary to other presentations that day came to be regarded as one of the greatest speeches in american history
in just over two minutes lincoln invoked the principles of human equality espoused by the declaration of independence and redefined the civil war as a struggle not merely for the union but as a new birth of freedom that would bring true equality to all of its citizens and that would also create a unified nation in which states rights were no longer dominant

beginning with the now iconic phrase four score and seven years ago lincoln referred to the events of the civil war and described the ceremony at gettysburg as an opportunity not only to consecrate the grounds of a cemetery but also to dedicate the living to the struggle to ensure that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth

despite the speech s prominent place in the history and popular culture of the united states the exact wording of the speech is disputed
the five known manuscripts of the gettysburg address differ in a number of details and also differ from contemporary newspaper reprints of the speech</section>

with an election looming he easily defeated efforts to deny his renomination
at the convention the republican party selected andrew johnson a war democrat from the southern state of tennessee as his running mate in order to form a broader coalition
they ran on the new union party ticket uniting republicans and war democrats

the only known photographs of lincoln giving a speech were taken as he delivered his second inaugural address
here he stands in the center with papers in his hand

nevertheless republicans across the country feared that lincoln would be defeated
acknowledging this fear lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that if he should lose the election he would still defeat the confederacy before turning over the white house 44 “ this morning as for some days past it seems exceedingly probable that this administration will not be re elected
then it will be my duty to so co operate with the president elect as to save the union between the election and the inauguration as he will have secured his election on such ground that he cannot possibly save it afterwards 45 ” lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet but asked them to sign the sealed envelope

while the democratic platform followed the peace wing of the party and called the war a failure their candidate general george b mcclellan supported the war and repudiated the platform

at this time a victory over the rebels was at hand slavery was dead and lincoln was looking to the future

fondly do we hope fervently do we pray that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away yet if god wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bond man s two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword as was said three thousand years ago so still it must be said the judgments of the lord are true and righteous altogether
with malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right as god gives us to see the right let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nation s wounds to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations 47</section>

september 2008 running the machine an 1864 political cartoon featuring lincoln william fessenden edwin stanton william seward and gideon welles take a swing at the lincoln administration the war was a source of constant frustration for the president and occupied nearly all of his time he had a contentious relationship with general mcclellan who became general in chief of all the union armies in the wake of the embarrassing union defeat at the first battle of bull run and after the retirement of winfield scott in late 1861 despite his inexperience in military affairs lincoln wanted to take an active part in determining war strategy
his priorities were twofold to ensure that washington d c
was well defended and to conduct an aggressive war effort in the hope of ending the war quickly and appeasing the northern public and press
mcclellan a youthful west point graduate and railroad executive called back to active military service took a more cautious approach
he took several months to plan and execute his peninsula campaign with the objective of capturing richmond by moving the army of the potomac by boat to the peninsula between the james and york rivers
mcclellan s delay irritated lincoln as did his insistence that no troops were needed to defend washington d c
lincoln insisted on holding some of mcclellan s troops to defend the capital a decision mcclellan blamed for the ultimate failure of the peninsula campaign

mcclellan a lifelong democrat who was temperamentally conservative was relieved as general in chief after releasing his harrison s landing letter where he offered unsolicited political advice to lincoln urging caution in the war effort
mcclellan s letter incensed radical republicans who successfully pressured lincoln to appoint john pope a republican as head of the new army of virginia
pope complied with lincoln s strategic desire to move toward richmond from the north thus protecting the capital from attack
but pope was soundly defeated at the second battle of bull run in the summer of 1862 forcing the army of the potomac to defend washington for a second time
in response to his failure pope was sent to minnesota to fight the sioux 48
an 1864 mathew brady photo depicts president lincoln reading a book with his youngest son tad panicked by lee s invasion of maryland lincoln restored mcclellan to command of all forces around washington in time for the battle of antietam september 1862
the ensuing union victory enabled lincoln to release his emancipation proclamation but he relieved mcclellan of his command shortly after the 1862 midterm elections and appointed republican ambrose burnside to head the army of the potomac
burnside had promised to follow through on lincoln s strategic vision for a strong offensive against lee and richmond
after burnside was stunningly defeated at fredericksburg joseph hooker was given the command despite his idle talk about the necessity for a military dictator to win the war and a past history of criticizing his commanders 49
hooker was routed by lee at the battle of chancellorsville may 1863 and relieved of command early in the subsequent gettysburg campaign replaced by george meade

after the union victory at gettysburg meade s failure to pursue lee and months of inactivity for the army of the potomac persuaded lincoln to bring in a western general ulysses s
grant
grant already had a solid string of victories in the western theater including the battles of vicksburg and chattanooga
responding to criticism of grant lincoln replied i can t spare this man
he fights 50
grant waged his bloody overland campaign in 1864 with a strategy of a war of attrition characterized by high union losses at battles such as the wilderness and cold harbor but by proportionately higher confederate losses
the high casualty figures alarmed the nation and after grant lost a third of his army lincoln asked what grant s plans were i propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer replied grant
lincoln and the republican party mobilized support throughout the north backed grant to the hilt and replaced his losses 51
the confederacy was out of replacements so lee s army shrank with every battle forcing it back to trenches outside petersburg
in april 1865 lee s army finally crumbled under grant s pounding and richmond fell

lincoln in a top hat with allan pinkerton and major general john alexander mcclernand at antietam lincoln authorized grant to target the confederate infrastructure such as plantations railroads and bridges hoping to destroy the south s morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting
this allowed generals sherman and sheridan to destroy plantations and towns in the shenandoah valley georgia and south carolina
the damage caused by sherman s march to the sea through georgia totaled in excess of $100 million by sherman s own estimate 52
lincoln possessed a keen understanding of strategic points such as the mississippi river and the fortress city of vicksburg and understood the importance of defeating the enemy s army rather than simply capturing cities
he had however limited success in motivating his commanders to adopt his strategies until late 1863 when he found a man who shared his vision of the war in ulysses s
grant
only then could he insist on using african american troops and relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters

throughout the war lincoln showed a keen curiosity with the military campaigns
he spent hours at the war department telegraph office reading dispatches from his generals
he visited battle sites frequently and seemed fascinated by scenes of war
during jubal anderson early s raid on washington d c in 1864 lincoln was watching the combat from an exposed position a captain shouted at him get down you damn fool before you get shot 53</section>
      <section name="reconstruction" length="2380" id="17">main article reconstruction era of the united states reconstruction began during the war as lincoln and his associates pondered questions of how to reintegrate the southern states and what to do with confederate leaders and the freed slaves
lincoln led the moderates regarding reconstruction policy and was usually opposed by the radical republicans under thaddeus stevens in the house and charles sumner and benjamin wade in the senate though he cooperated with these men on most other issues
determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the south lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war in areas behind union lines
his amnesty proclamation of december 8 1863 offered pardons to those who had not held a confederate civil office had not mistreated union prisoners and would sign an oath of allegiance 54
critical decisions had to be made as state after state was reconquered
of special importance were tennessee where lincoln appointed andrew johnson as governor and louisiana where lincoln attempted a plan that would restore statehood when 10 % of the voters agreed to it
the radicals thought this policy too lenient and passed their own plan the wade davis bill in 1864 when lincoln pocket vetoed the bill the radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from louisiana arkansas and tennessee 55 near the end of the war lincoln made an extended visit to grant s headquarters at city point virginia
this allowed the president to visit richmond after it was taken by the union forces and to make a public gesture of sitting at jefferson davis s own desk symbolically saying to the nation that the president of the united states held authority over the entire land he was greeted at the city as a conquering hero by freed slaves whose sentiments were epitomized by one admirer s quote i know i am free for i have seen the face of father abraham and have felt him when a general asked lincoln how the defeated confederates should be treated lincoln replied let em up easy 56 lincoln arrived back in washington on the evening of april 9 1865 the day lee surrendered at appomattox court house in virginia the war was effectively over the other rebel armies surrendered soon after and there was no subsequent guerrilla warfare 57</section>

the gettysburg address defied lincoln s own prediction that the world will little note nor long remember what we say here his second inaugural address is also greatly admired and often quoted

in recent years historians have stressed lincoln s use of and redefinition of republican values
as early as the 1850s a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the constitution lincoln shifted emphasis to the declaration of independence as the foundation of american political values what he called the sheet anchor of republicanism 58
the declaration s emphasis on freedom and equality for all rather than the constitution s tolerance of slavers shifted the debate
as diggins concludes regarding the highly influential cooper union speech lincoln presented americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself 59
his position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism rather than its legalisms 60 61
nevertheless in 1861 lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms the constitution was a contract and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state 62
that duty was also the principle underlying federal intervention in reconstruction

in his gettysburg address lincoln redefined the american nation arguing that it was born not in 1789 but in 1776 conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal
he declared that the sacrifices of battle had rededicated the nation to the propositions of democracy and equality that this nation shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth
by emphasizing the centrality of the nation he rebuffed the claims of state sovereignty
while some critics say lincoln moved too far and too fast they agree that he dedicated the nation to values that marked a new founding of the nation 63</section>

thus he signed the homestead act in 1862 making millions of acres of government held land in the west available for purchase at very low cost the morrill land grant colleges act also signed in 1862 provided government grants for agricultural universities in each state
the pacific railway acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the united states first transcontinental railroad which was completed in 1869

other important legislation involved two measures to raise revenues for the federal goverment tariffs a policy with long precedent and a federal income tax which was new
in 1861 lincoln signed the second and third morrill tariff the first had become law under james buchanan
in 1862 lincoln signed legislation creating the first u s income tax
marginal rates were 3 % on incomes between $600 and $10 000 and 5% on income above $10 000
adjusted for inflation $600 was the equivalent of $12 325 in 2007 us dollars
in 1864 income tax rates were raised to 5% on incomes between $600 and $5 000 7 5% on income between $5 000 and $10 000 and 10 % tax on income above that

lincoln also presided over the creation of the system of national banks by the national banking acts of 1863 1864 and 1865 which allowed the creation of a strong national financial system
congress created and lincoln approved the department of agriculture in 1862 although that institution would not become a cabinet level department until 1889

the legal tender act of 1862 established the united states note the first paper currency in united states history since the continentals that were issued during the revolution
this was done to increase the money supply to pay for fighting the war

during the war lincoln s treasury department effectively controlled all cotton trade in the occupied south the most dramatic incursion of federal controls on the economy

in 1862 lincoln sent a senior general john pope to put down the sioux uprising in minnesota presented with 303 death warrants for convicted santee dakota who were accused of killing innocent farmers lincoln affirmed 39 of these for execution one was later reprieved

learning that the president and first lady would be attending ford s theatre he laid his plans assigning his co conspirators to assassinate vice president andrew johnson and secretary of state william h seward

without his main bodyguard ward hill lamon to whom he related his famous dream regarding his own assassination lincoln left to attend the play our american cousin on april 14 1865 as a lone bodyguard wandered and lincoln sat in his state box box 7 in the balcony booth crept up behind the president and waited for what he thought would be the funniest line of the play you sock dologizing old man trap hoping the laughter would muffle the noise of the gunshot
when the laughter began booth jumped into the box and aimed a single shot round slug 0 44 caliber derringer at his head firing at point blank range

      <section name="religious and philosophical beliefs" length="5025" id="24">further information abraham lincoln and religion in march 1860 in a speech in new haven connecticut lincoln said with respect to slavery “whenever this question shall be settled it must be settled on some philosophical basis
no policy that does not rest upon some philosophical public opinion can be permanently maintained
the philosophical basis for lincoln’s beliefs regarding slavery and other issues of the day require that lincoln be examined seriously as a man of ideas
lincoln was a strong supporter of the american whig version of liberal capitalism who more than most politicians of the time was able to express his ideas within the context of nineteenth century religious beliefs 68
there were few people who strongly or directly influenced lincoln’s moral and intellectual development and perspectives
there was no teacher mentor church leader community leader or peer that lincoln would credit in later years as a strong influence on his intellectual development
lacking a formal education lincoln’s personal philosophy was shaped by an amazingly retentive memory and a passion for reading and learning
it was lincoln’s reading rather than his relationships that were most influential in shaping his personal beliefs 69 70
lincoln did even as a boy largely reject organized religion but the calvinistic doctrine of necessity would remain a factor throughout his life
in 1846 lincoln described the effect of this doctrine as that the human mind is impelled to action or held in rest by some power over which the mind itself has no control 71
in april 1864 in justifying his actions in regard to emancipation lincoln wrote i claim not to have controlled events but confess plainly that events have controlled me
now at the end of three years struggle the nation s condition is not what either party or any man devised or expected
god alone can claim it 72 as lincoln matured and especially during his term as president the idea of a divine will somehow interacting with human affairs more and more influenced his public expressions
on a personal level the death of his son willie in february 1862 may have caused lincoln to look towards religion for answers and solace 73
after willie’s death in the summer or early fall of 1862 lincoln attempted to put on paper his private musings on why from a divine standpoint the severity of the war was necessary the will of god prevails
in great contests each party claims to act in accordance with the will of god both may be and one must be wrong
god cannot be for and against the same thing at the same time
in the present civil war it is quite possible that god s purpose is something different from the purpose of either party and yet the human instrumentalities working just as they do are of the best adaptation to effect his purpose
i am almost ready to say this is probably true that god wills this contest and wills that it shall not end yet
by his mere quiet power on the minds of the now contestants he could have either saved or destroyed the union without a human contest
yet the contest began
and having begun he could give the final victory to either side any day
yet the contest proceeds 74
lincoln’s religious skepticism was fueled by his exposure to the ideas of the lockean enlightenment and classical liberalism especially economic liberalism 69
consistent with the common practice of the whig party lincoln would often use the declaration of independence as the philosophical and moral expression of these two philosophies 75
in a february 22 1861 speech at independence hall in philadelphia lincoln said i have never had a feeling politically that did not spring from the sentiments embodied in the declaration of independence … it was not the mere matter of the separation of the colonies from the motherland but that sentiment in the declaration of independence which gave liberty not alone to the people of this country but i hope to the world for all future time it was that which gave promise that in due time the weight would be lifted from the shoulders of all men
this is a sentiment embodied in the declaration of independence 76 he found in the declaration justification for whig economic policy and opposition to territorial expansion and the nativist platform of the know nothings
in claiming that all men were created free lincoln and the whigs argued that this freedom required economic advancement expanded education territory to grow and the ability of the nation to absorb the growing immigrant population 77
it was the declaration of independence rather than the bible that lincoln most relied on in order to oppose any further territorial expansion of slavery
he saw the declaration as more than a political document
to him as well as to many abolitionists and other antislavery leaders it was foremost a moral document that had forever determined valuable criteria in shaping the future of the nation 78</section>

claims that lincoln had syphilis about 1835 have been controversial but a recent analysis finds them credible 80
despite having multiple illnesses in his life his health up until middle age was not particularly poor for his day 81 as a child lincoln was tall for his age
he reached his adult height of 6 feet 4 inches 1 93 m no later than age 21
friends noticed his arms legs hands and feet were long although well muscled as a young adult he was always thin fragmentary evidence says he weighed over 200 pounds in his mid 20s but his official weight upon his taking office as president was 180 pounds and he is believed to have weighed even less further along in his presidency
based on lincoln s unusual physical appearance dr abraham gordon proposed in 1962 that lincoln had marfan syndrome 82
lincoln s unremarkable cardiovascular history and his normal visual acuity have been the chief objections to the theory and today the diagnosis is considered unlikely 83
testing lincoln s dna for marfan syndrome was contemplated in the 1990s but such a test was not performed

in 2007 dr john sotos proposed that lincoln had multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2b men2b 84
this theory suggests lincoln had all the major features of the disease a marfan like body shape large bumpy lips constipation hypotonia a history compatible with cancer and a family history of the disorder his sons eddie willie and tad and probably his mother
the mole on lincoln s right cheek the asymmetry of his face his large jaw his drooping eyelid and pseudo depression are also suggested as manifestations of men2b
lincoln s longevity is the principal challenge to the men2b theory which could be proven by dna testing

lincoln was regularly reported to suffer from melancholy
some biographers have controversially diagnosed him with clinical depression and bipolar disorder but these theories have generally been dismissed 85
mainly his reported melancholy affected at times of great political stress or warfare and after losing a loved one neither of which are unusual
he lost the two women his mother and his sister he loved very much when he was extremely young
this melancholy was also reinforced later in his life by the losses of his stepmother and his very first love ann rutledge
mary lincoln felt her husband to be too trusting and his melancholy also struck at times he was betrayed or unsupported by those he put faith in 86 other people have suggested that he was simply a private person who took solace in solitude
they argue that this can be seen in some of his actions as both a young boy and adult
some of these actions included withdrawing himself from a crowd to read when he was a little boy and even retreating to his privacy to find a solution to a problem
as an adult lincoln would often slip into depression and emerge a short time later full of humor and happiness
some people suggest that lincoln s humor was actually a healthy way to cope with his depression 87
unlike the quiet deep voice later used by impersonators and actors lincoln reportedly had a strikingly high pitched speaking voice which aided him at times when he needed to be heard by crowds of thousands before the existence of microphones
despite his legendary talent as orator he was said to have been shy and awkward in intimate social situations especially in his youth</section>

he successfully led the country through its greatest internal crisis the american civil war preserving the union and ending slavery
as the war was drawing to a close lincoln became the first american president to be assassinated
before his election in 1860 as the first republican president lincoln had been a lawyer an illinois state legislator a member of the united states house of representatives and twice an unsuccessful candidate for election to the u s
senate

as an outspoken opponent of the expansion of slavery in the united states 1 2 lincoln won the republican party nomination in 1860 and was elected president later that year his tenure in office was occupied primarily with the defeat of the secessionist confederate states of america in the american civil war
he introduced measures that resulted in the abolition of slavery issuing his emancipation proclamation in 1863 and promoting the passage of the thirteenth amendment to the constitution which passed congress before lincoln s death and was ratified by the states later in 1865

lincoln closely supervised the victorious war effort especially the selection of top generals including ulysses s
grant
historians have concluded that he handled the factions of the republican party well bringing leaders of each faction into his cabinet and forcing them to cooperate
lincoln successfully defused the trent affair a war scare with britain in 1861 under his leadership the union took control of the border slave states at the start of the war
additionally he managed his own reelection in the 1864 presidential election

copperheads and other opponents of the war criticized lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue
conversely the radical republicans an abolitionist faction of the republican party criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery
even with these road blocks lincoln successfully rallied public opinion through his rhetoric and speeches his gettysburg address is but one example of this at the close of the war lincoln held a moderate view of reconstruction seeking to speedily reunite the nation through a policy of generous reconciliation
his successor in the white house andrew johnson also wanted reconciliation among white americans but failed to protect the rights of newly freed slaves
lincoln s assassination in 1865 was the first presidential assassination in u s history
he has since consistently been ranked by scholars as one of the greatest u s

      <section name="childhood and education" length="3625" id="2">samuel lincoln first american ancestor of abraham worshipped at old ship church hingham massachusetts abraham lincoln was born on february 12 1809 to thomas lincoln and nancy hanks two uneducated farmers in a one room log cabin on the 348 acre 1 4 km2 sinking spring farm in southeast hardin county kentucky now part of larue county making him the first president born outside the original thirteen colonies
lincoln s ancestor samuel lincoln 4 had arrived in hingham massachusetts from england in the 17th century but his descendants had gradually moved west from pennsylvania to virginia and then westward to the frontier 5
symbolic log cabin at the abraham lincoln birthplace national historic site for some time thomas lincoln abraham s father had been a respected citizen of the kentucky backcountry
he had purchased the sinking spring farm in december 1808 for $200 cash $2 73 thousand today 6 and assumption of a debt the family belonged to a hardshell baptist church although abraham himself never joined their church or any other church for that matter

in 1816 the lincoln family became impoverished losing their land through court action and was forced to make a new start in perry county indiana 7
lincoln later noted that this move was partly on account of slavery and partly because of difficulties with land deeds in kentucky 8 when lincoln was nine his mother then 34 years old died of milk sickness
soon afterwards his father remarried to sarah bush johnston
lincoln and his stepmother were close he called her mother for the rest of his life but he was increasingly distant from his father 9
in 1830 after more economic and land title difficulties in indiana the family settled on public land 10 in macon county illinois
the following winter was desolate and especially brutal and the family considered moving back to indiana
the following year when his father relocated the family to a new homestead in coles county illinois 22 year old lincoln struck out on his own canoeing down the sangamon river to the village of new salem in sangamon county 11
later that year hired by new salem businessman denton offutt and accompanied by friends he took goods from new salem to new orleans via flatboat on the sangamon illinois and mississippi rivers

lincoln s formal education consisted of about 18 months of schooling but he was largely self educated and an avid reader
he was also a talented local wrestler and skilled with an axe 12 lincoln avoided hunting and fishing because he did not like killing animals even for food 13 at 6 foot 4 inches 1 93 m he was unusually tall as well as strong

lincoln s father thomas lincoln was uneducated and illiterate however he was extremely talented in the art of storytelling and entertaining friends
thomas would regularly host friendly gatherings at his house which would usually consist of thomas telling stories all night causing a hilarious uproar from his audience
stealthily young abraham would stay up and listen to his father telling stories trying to memorize them himself
occasionally when abraham could not understand a certain story or part of one he would repeat it over and over again in his mind until he finally understood
he then would spend countless hours coming up with a way to put the stories into terms his friends could easily understand
the next day abraham would repeat these stories to his friends mimicking his father
this early practice helped prepare abraham for the many important speeches he would have to give late in his life 14</section>
      <section name="marriage and family" length="2135" id="3">further information sexuality of abraham lincoln on november 4 1842 lincoln married mary todd daughter of a prominent slave owning family from kentucky
the couple had four sons robert todd lincoln was born in springfield illinois on august 1 1843 their only child to survive into adulthood young robert attended phillips exeter academy and harvard college

the other lincoln children were born in springfield illinois and died either during childhood or their teen years
edward baker lincoln was born on march 10 1846 and died on february 1 1850 also in springfield william willie wallace lincoln was born on december 21 1850 and died on february 20 1862 in washington d c during president lincoln s first term thomas tad lincoln was born on april 4 1853 and died on july 16 1871 in chicago

lincoln was not lucky when it came to women
having lost his first love ann rutledge to what could possibly have been typhoid fever he courted mary owens the sister of his friend elizabeth abell with the promise of marriage
lincoln finally proposed to owens in may 1837 but the proposal was less than appealing to her
eighteen months after that rejection however lincoln became engaged to mary todd finally in november 1842 after an eighteen month break in their engagement they were married in the parlor of the edwards mansion
eventually after their marriage they settled into a quaint house on eighth and jackson in springfield which was conveniently located within walking distance of his law office
mary had a hard time adjusting to her new life because she was used to having slaves perform most of the chores all of her life also because mary was used to having money her entire life she struggled with the adjustment to relative poverty
even though abraham and mary struggled with the first couple of years of their marriage the births of two sons within the first forty months of their marriage helped relieve some of that tension
the lincolns did not believe in rules and boundaries when it came to their children
they were free and able to do anything they pleased 15</section>
      <section name="early political career and military service" length="1298" id="4">main article abraham lincoln s early life and career sketch of a younger abraham lincoln lincoln began his political career in 1832 at age 23 with an unsuccessful campaign for the illinois general assembly as a member of the whig party
the centerpiece of his platform was the undertaking of navigational improvements on the sangamon river
later that year he served as a captain in a company of the illinois militia during the black hawk war although he never saw combat

in 1834 he won an election to the state legislature and after coming across the commentaries on the laws of england began to teach himself law
admitted to the bar in 1837 he moved to springfield illinois that same year and began to practice law with john t
stuart
with a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross examinations and in his closing arguments lincoln became an able and successful lawyer 16
in 1841 lincoln entered the law practice with william herndon a fellow whig

he served four successive terms in the illinois house of representatives as a representative from sangamon county and became a leader of the illinois whig party
in 1837 he made his first protest against slavery in the illinois house stating that the institution was founded on both injustice and bad policy 17</section>
      <section name="illinois politics" length="2107" id="5">lincoln in 1846 or 1847 in 1846 lincoln was elected to one term in the u s
house of representatives
a staunch whig lincoln often referred to party leader henry clay as his political idol as a freshman house member lincoln was not a particularly powerful or influential figure in congress he used his office as an opportunity to speak out against the war with mexico which he attributed to president polk s desire for military glory that attractive rainbow that rises in showers of blood
lincoln s most famous stand against polk was in his spot resolutions the war had begun with a violent confrontation on disputed territory claimed by both mexico and texas but polk had insisted that mexican soldiers had invaded our territory shed the blood of our fellow citizens on our own soil 18
lincoln demanded that polk show congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and proof that that spot was on american soil congress never enacted the resolution or even debated it and its introduction resulted in a loss of political support for lincoln in his district one illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him spotty lincoln 19
lincoln was a key early supporter of zachary taylor s candidacy for the 1848 whig presidential nomination
when lincoln s term ended the incoming taylor administration offered him the governorship of remote oregon territory
acceptance would end his career in the fast growing state of illinois so he declined
returning instead to springfield illinois he turned most of his energies to making a living at the bar which involved extensive travel on horseback from county to county

it was during this stage of his life however that lincoln gave one of the most pivotal speeches 2 of his life speaking not as a politician but as a private citizen
opposed to the 1854 kansas nebraska act lincoln spoke to a crowd in peoria illinois on october 16 1854 outlining the moral political and economic arguments against slavery 3 that he would continue to uphold throughout his career
this speech marked his re entry into public life</section>
      <section name="prairie lawyer" length="1893" id="6">by the mid 1850s lincoln faced competing transportation interests both the river barges and the railroads
originally lincoln had favored riverboat interests
in 1849 he had received a patent for a device to buoy vessels over shoals
lincoln s goal had been to lessen the draft of a river craft by pushing horizontal floats into the water alongside the hull the floats would have served as temporary ballast tanks 20 21
the concept was never commercialized
lincoln was the only president of the united states to hold a patent
