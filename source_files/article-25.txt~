these signs all begin before a child is three years old 1 autism affects many parts of the brain how this occurs is not understood 2 the autism spectrum disorders asd also include the related conditions asperger syndrome and pdd nos which have fewer signs and symptoms 3
autism has a strong genetic basis although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether asd is explained more by multigene interactions or by rare mutations 4
in rare cases autism is strongly associated with agents that cause birth defects 5
controversies surround other proposed environmental causes such as heavy metals pesticides or childhood vaccines 6 the vaccine hypotheses are biologically implausible and lack convincing scientific evidence 7
the prevalence of asd is about 6 per 1 000 people with about four times as many males as females
the number of people known to have autism has increased dramatically since the 1980s partly due to changes in diagnostic practice the question of whether actual prevalence has increased is unresolved 8
parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child s life although early behavioral or cognitive intervention can help children gain self care social and communication skills there is no known cure 9 not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood though some become successful 10
an autistic culture has developed with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be tolerated as a difference and not treated as a disorder 11

      <section name="characteristics" length="733" id="1">autism is a highly variable brain development disorder 12 that first appears during infancy or childhood and generally follows a steady course without remission 13
symptoms tend to continue through adulthood although often in more muted form 14 it is distinguished not by a single symptom but by a characteristic triad of symptoms impairments in social interaction impairments in communication and restricted interests and repetitive behavior
other aspects such as atypical eating are also common but are not essential for diagnosis 15
autism s individual symptoms occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits 16</section>
      <section name="social development" length="2578" id="2">social deficits distinguish autism and the related autism spectrum disorders asd see classification from other developmental disorders 14
people with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted
noted autistic temple grandin described her inability to understand the social communication of neurotypicals or people with normal neural development as leaving her feeling like an anthropologist on mars 17 unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli smile and look at others less often and respond less to their own name autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms for example they have less eye contact and turn taking and are more likely to communicate by manipulating another person s hand 18 three to five year old autistic children are less likely to exhibit social understanding approach others spontaneously imitate and respond to emotions communicate nonverbally and take turns with others
however they do form attachments to their primary caregivers 19
they display moderately less attachment security than usual although this feature disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe asd 20 older children and adults with asd perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition 21
contrary to common beliefs autistic children do not prefer being alone
making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism
for them the quality of friendships not the number of friends predicts how lonely they feel functional friendships such as those resulting in invitations to parties may affect their quality of life more deeply 22
there are many anecdotal reports but few systematic studies of aggression and violence in individuals with asd the limited data suggest that in children with mental retardation autism is associated with aggression destruction of property and tantrums
a 2007 study interviewed parents of 67 children with asd and reported that about two thirds of the children had periods of severe tantrums and about one third had a history of aggression with tantrums significantly more common than in children with a history of language impairment 23
a 2008 swedish study found that of individuals aged 15 or older discharged from hospital with a diagnosis of asd those who committed violent crimes were significantly more likely to have other psychopathological conditions such as psychosis 24</section>
      <section name="communication" length="1701" id="3">about a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs 25
differences in communication may be present from the first year of life and may include delayed onset of babbling unusual gestures diminished responsiveness and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver
in the second and third years autistic children have less frequent and less diverse babbling consonants words and word combinations their gestures are less often integrated with words
autistic children are less likely to make requests or share experiences and are more likely to simply repeat others words echolalia 26 27 or reverse pronouns 28
joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with asd 3 for example they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed at object 18 27 and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience 3
autistic children may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language 26 27
in a pair of studies high functioning autistic children aged 8–15 performed equally well and adults better than individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling
both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language comprehension and inference
as people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends 29</section>
      <section name="repetitive behavior" length="1334" id="4">a young boy with autism and the precise line of toys he made autistic individuals display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior which the repetitive behavior scale revised rbs r 30 categorizes as follows

stereotypy is repetitive movement such as hand flapping making sounds head rolling or body rocking

compulsive behavior is intended and appears to follow rules such as arranging objects in a certain way

sameness is resistance to change for example insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted

ritualistic behavior involves the performance of daily activities the same way each time such as an unvarying menu or dressing ritual
this is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the two factors 31
restricted behavior is limited in focus interest or activity such as preoccupation with a single television program or toy

self injury includes movements that injure or can injure the person such as eye poking skin picking hand biting and head banging 3
a 2007 study reported that self injury at some point affected about 30 % of children with asd 23 no single repetitive behavior seems to be specific to autism but only autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors 30</section>
      <section name="other symptoms" length="2366" id="5">autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis but that can affect the individual or the family 15
an estimated 0 5% to 10 % of individuals with asd show unusual abilities ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants 32
many individuals with asd show superior skills in perception and attention relative to the general population 33
unusual responses to sensory stimuli are more common and prominent in autistic children although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders 34
differences are greater for under responsivity for example walking into things than for over responsivity for example distress from loud noises or for sensation seeking for example rhythmic movements 35
several studies have reported associated motor problems that include poor muscle tone poor motor planning and toe walking asd is not associated with severe motor disturbances 36
unusual eating behavior occurs in about three quarters of children with asd to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator
selectivity is the most common problem although eating rituals and food refusal also occur 23 this does not appear to result in malnutrition
although some children with autism also have gastrointestinal gi symptoms there is a lack of published rigorous data to support the theory that autistic children have more or different gi symptoms than usual 37 studies report conflicting results and the relationship between gi problems and asd is unclear 9
at some point in childhood about two thirds of individuals with asd are affected by sleep problems these most commonly include symptoms of insomnia such as difficulty in falling asleep frequent nocturnal awakenings and early morning awakenings sleep problems are associated with difficult behaviors and family stress and are often a focus of clinical attention over and above the primary asd diagnosis 38
parents of children with asd have higher levels of stress 39
siblings of children with asd report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling siblings of individuals with asd have greater risk of negative well being and poorer sibling relationships as adults 40</section>
      <section name="classification" length="3436" id="6">leo kanner introduced the label early infantile autism in 1943

autism is one of the five pervasive developmental disorders pdd which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior 13
these symptoms do not imply sickness fragility or emotional disturbance 14
of the five pdd forms asperger syndrome is closest to autism in signs and likely causes rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism but may have unrelated causes pdd not otherwise specified pdd nos also called atypical autism is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder 41
unlike autism asperger s has no substantial delay in language development 1
the terminology of autism can be bewildering with autism asperger s and pdd nos often called the autism spectrum disorders asd 9 or sometimes the autistic disorders 42 whereas autism itself is often called autistic disorder childhood autism or infantile autism
in this article autism refers to the classic autistic disorder in clinical practice though autism asd and pdd are often used interchangeably 43
asd in turn is a subset of the broader autism phenotype bap which describes individuals who may not have asd but do have autistic like traits such as avoiding eye contact 44
the manifestations of autism cover a wide spectrum ranging from individuals with severe impairments who may be silent mentally disabled and locked into hand flapping and rocking to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches narrowly focused interests and verbose pedantic communication 45
sometimes the syndrome is divided into low medium or high functioning autism lfa mfa and hfa based on iq thresholds 46 or on how much support the individual requires in daily life these subdivisions are not standardized and are controversial
autism can also be divided into syndromal and non syndromal autism the syndromal autism is associated with severe or profound mental retardation or a congenital syndrome with physical symptoms such as tuberous sclerosis 47
although individuals with asperger s tend to perform better cognitively than those with autism the extent of the overlap between asperger s hfa and non syndromal autism is unclear 48
some studies have reported diagnoses of autism in children due to a loss of language or social skills as opposed to a failure to make progress typically from 15 to 30 months of age
the validity of this distinction remains controversial it is possible that regressive autism is a specific subtype 18 26 49 50 or that there is a continuum of behaviors between autism with and without regression 51
research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subpopulations 52 and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of psychiatry psychology neurology and pediatrics 53
newer technologies such as fmri can help identify biologically relevant phenotypes observable traits that can be viewed on brain scans to help further neurogenetic studies of autism 54
it has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior with the name type 1 autism denoting rare autism cases that test positive for a mutation in the cntnap2 gene 55</section>
      <section name="causes" length="3398" id="7">main article causes of autism it has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic cognitive and neural levels for autism s characteristic triad of symptoms 56
however there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co occur 56 57
deletion 1 duplication 2 and inversion 3 are all chromosome abnormalities that have been implicated in autism 58 autism has a strong genetic basis although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether asd is explained more by multigene interactions or by rare mutations with major effects 4
complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes the environment and epigenetic factors which do not change dna but are heritable and influence gene expression 14
early studies of twins estimated heritability explains more than 90 % of the risk of autism assuming a shared environment and no other genetic or medical syndromes 42
however most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified
typically autism cannot be traced to a mendelian single gene mutation or to a single chromosome abnormality like angelman syndrome or fragile x syndrome and none of the genetic syndromes associated with asds has been shown to selectively cause asd 4 numerous candidate genes have been located with only small effects attributable to any particular gene 4 the large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from copy number variations spontaneous deletions or duplications in genetic material during meiosis 59
hence a substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited that is the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome 58
gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on activity dependent changes and that the symptoms may be reversed or reduced by replacing or modulating gene function after birth 60
all known teratogens agents that cause birth defects related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from conception and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later it is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development 5 although evidence for other environmental causes is anecdotal and has not been confirmed by reliable studies 6 extensive searches are underway 61
environmental factors that have been claimed to contribute to or exacerbate autism or may be important in future research include certain foods infectious disease heavy metals solvents diesel exhaust pcbs phthalates and phenols used in plastic products pesticides brominated flame retardants alcohol smoking illicit drugs vaccines 8 and prenatal stress 62
parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination and this has given rise to theories that vaccines or their preservatives cause autism
although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible parental concern about autism has led to lower rates of childhood immunizations and higher likelihood of measles outbreaks 7</section>
      <section name="mechanism" length="439" id="8">autism s symptoms result from maturation related changes in various systems of the brain 63
despite extensive investigation how autism occurs is not well understood
its mechanism can be divided into two areas the pathophysiology of brain structures and processes associated with autism and the neuropsychological linkages between brain structures and behaviors 63
the behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologies 16</section>
      <section name="pathophysiology" length="6300" id="9">autism affects the amygdala cerebellum and many other parts of the brain 2
unlike many other brain disorders such as parkinson s autism does not have a clear unifying mechanism at either the molecular cellular or systems level it is not known whether autism is a few disorders caused by mutations converging on a few common molecular pathways or is like intellectual disability a large set of disorders with diverse mechanisms 12
autism appears to result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems 64 and to disturb the timing of brain development more than the final product 2
neuroanatomical studies and the associations with teratogens strongly suggest that autism s mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception 5
this anomaly appears to start a cascade of pathological events in the brain that are significantly influenced by environmental factors 65
although many major structures of the human brain have been implicated almost all postmortem studies have been of individuals who also had mental retardation making it difficult to draw conclusions 2
brain weight and volume and head circumference tend to be greater in autistic children 66
the cellular and molecular bases of pathological early overgrowth are not known nor is it known whether the overgrown neural systems cause autism s characteristic signs
current hypotheses include an excess of neurons that causes local overconnectivity in key brain regions 67
disturbed neuronal migration during early gestation 68 69
unbalanced excitatory–inhibitory networks 69
abnormal formation of synapses and dendritic spines 69 for example by modulation of the neurexin–neuroligin cell adhesion system 70 or by poorly regulated synthesis of synaptic protein 71
disrupted synaptic development may also contribute to epilepsy which may explain why the two conditions are associated 72
interactions between the immune system and the nervous system begin early during the embryonic stage of life and successful neurodevelopment depends on a balanced immune response
several symptoms consistent with a poorly regulated immune response have been reported in autistic children
it is possible that aberrant immune activity during critical periods of neurodevelopment is part of the mechanism of some forms of asd 73 as autoantibodies have not been associated with pathology are found in conditions other than asd and are not always present in asd 74 the relationship between immune disturbances and autism remains unclear and controversial 68
several neurotransmitter abnormalities have been detected in autism notably increased blood levels of serotonin
whether these cause structural or behavioral abnormalities is unclear 63
some data suggest an increase in several growth hormones other data argue for diminished growth factors 75
also some inborn errors of metabolism are associated with autism but probably account for less than 5% of cases 76
the mirror neuron system mns theory of autism hypothesizes that distortion in the development of the mns interferes with imitation and leads to autism s core features of social impairment and communication difficulties
the mns operates when an animal performs an action or observes another animal perform the same action
the mns may contribute to an individual s understanding of other people by enabling the modeling of their behavior via embodied simulation of their actions intentions and emotions 77
several studies have tested this hypothesis by demonstrating structural abnormalities in mns regions of individuals with asd delay in the activation in the core circuit for imitation in individuals with asperger s and a correlation between reduced mns activity and severity of the syndrome in children with asd 78 however individuals with autism also have abnormal brain activation in many circuits outside the mns 79 and the mns theory does not explain the normal performance of autistic children on imitation tasks that involve a goal or object 80
autistic individuals tend to use different areas of the brain yellow for a movement task compared to a control group blue
this image was generated by fmri 81 which is used in autism research to measure neural activity 82
asd related patterns of low function and aberrant activation in the brain differ depending on whether the brain is doing social or nonsocial tasks 83
in autism there is evidence for reduced functional connectivity of the default network a large scale brain network involved in social and emotional processing with intact connectivity of the task positive network used in sustained attention and goal directed thinking
in people with autism the two networks are not negatively correlated in time suggesting an imbalance in toggling between the two networks possibly reflecting a disturbance of self referential thought 84
a 2008 brain imaging study found a specific pattern of signals in the cingulate cortex which differs in individuals with asd 85 the underconnectivity theory of autism hypothesizes that autism is marked by underfunctioning high level neural connections and synchronization along with an excess of low level processes 86
evidence for this theory has been found in functional neuroimaging studies on autistic individuals 29 and by a brain wave study that suggested that adults with asd have local overconnectivity in the cortex and weak functional connections between the frontal lobe and the rest of the cortex 87
other evidence suggests the underconnectivity is mainly within each hemisphere of the cortex and that autism is a disorder of the association cortex 88
from studies based on event related potentials transient changes to the brain s electrical activity in response to stimuli there is considerable evidence for differences in autistic individuals with respect to attention orientiation to auditory and visual stimuli novelty detection language and face processing and information storage several studies have found a preference for non social stimuli 89
for example magnetoencephalography studies have found evidence in autistic children of delayed responses in the brain s processing of auditory signals 90</section>
      <section name="neuropsychology" length="2892" id="10">two major categories of cognitive theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behavior

the first category focuses on deficits in social cognition
the empathizing–systemizing theory postulates that autistic individuals can systemize that is they can develop internal rules of operation to handle events inside the brain but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents
an extension the extreme male brain theory hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain defined psychometrically as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing 91 this extension is controversial as many studies contradict the idea that baby boys and girls respond differently to people and objects 92
these theories are related to the earlier theory of mind approach which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others
although the theory of mind is supported by autistic children s atypical responses to the sally–anne test for reasoning about others motivations 91 and is mapped well from the mirror neuron system theory of autism 78 most studies have found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals ability to understand other people s basic emotions or goals instead data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others viewpoints 93
the second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing
executive dysfunction hypothesizes that autistic behavior results in part from deficits in working memory planning inhibition and other forms of executive function 94
tests of core executive processes such as eye movement tasks indicate improvement from late childhood to adolescence but performance never reaches typical adult levels 95
a strength of the theory is predicting stereotyped behavior and narrow interests 96 two weaknesses are that executive function is hard to measure 94 and that executive function deficits have not been found in young autistic children 21
weak central coherence theory hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in autism
one strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people 97
a related theory enhanced perceptual functioning focuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and perceptual operations in autistic individuals 98
these theories map well from the underconnectivity theory of autism

neither category is satisfactory on its own social cognition theories poorly address autism s rigid and repetitive behaviors while the nonsocial theories have difficulty explaining social impairment and communication difficulties 57
a combined theory based on multiple deficits may prove to be more useful 99</section>
      <section name="screening" length="1717" id="11">about half of parents of children with asd notice their child s unusual behaviors by age 18 months and about four fifths notice by age 24 months 50
as postponing treatment may affect long term outcome any of the following signs is reason to have a child evaluated by a specialist without delay no babbling by 12 months

no gesturing pointing waving goodbye etc by 12 months

no single words by 16 months

no two word spontaneous phrases other than instances of echolalia by 24 months

any loss of any language or social skills at any age 15 the american academy of pediatrics recommends that all children be screened for asd at the 18 and 24 month well child doctor visits using autism specific formal screening tests 3
in contrast the uk national screening committee recommends against screening for asd in the general population because screening tools have not been fully validated and interventions lack sufficient evidence for effectiveness 100
screening tools include the modified checklist for autism in toddlers m chat the early screening of autistic traits questionnaire and the first year inventory initial data on m chat and its predecessor chat on children aged 18–30 months suggests that it is best used in a clinical setting and that it has low sensitivity many false negatives but good specificity few false positives 50
it may be more accurate to precede these tests with a broadband screener that does not distinguish asd from other developmental disorders 101
screening tools designed for one culture s norms for behaviors like eye contact may be inappropriate for a different culture 102
genetic screening for autism is generally still impractical 103</section>
      <section name="diagnosis" length="4541" id="12">diagnosis is based on behavior not cause or mechanism 16 104
autism is defined in the dsm iv tr as exhibiting at least six symptoms total including at least two symptoms of qualitative impairment in social interaction at least one symptom of qualitative impairment in communication and at least one symptom of restricted and repetitive behavior
sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language and persistent preoccupation with parts of objects
onset must be prior to age three years with delays or abnormal functioning in either social interaction language as used in social communication or symbolic or imaginative play the disturbance must not be better accounted for by rett syndrome or childhood disintegrative disorder 1
icd 10 uses essentially the same definition 13
several diagnostic instruments are available
two are commonly used in autism research the autism diagnostic interview revised adi r is a semistructured parent interview and the autism diagnostic observation schedule ados uses observation and interaction with the child
the childhood autism rating scale cars is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children 18
a pediatrician commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child
if warranted diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from asd specialists observing and assessing cognitive communication family and other factors using standardized tools and taking into account any associated medical conditions 105
a pediatric neuropsychologist is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions 106
a differential diagnosis for asd at this stage might also consider mental retardation hearing impairment and a specific language impairment 105 such as landau–kleffner syndrome 107
clinical genetics evaluations are often done once asd is diagnosed particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause 43
although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated 40 % of cases to genetic causes 108 consensus guidelines in the u s and uk are limited to high resolution chromosome and fragile x testing 43
a genotype first model of diagnosis has been proposed which would routinely assess the genome s copy number variations 109
as new genetic tests are developed several ethical legal and social issues will emerge commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results given the complexity of autism s genetics 103
metabolic and neuroimaging tests are sometimes helpful but are not routine 43 asd can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life for example a one year old who meets diagnostic criteria for asd is less likely than a three year old to continue to do so a few years later 50
in the uk the national autism plan for children recommends at most 30 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment though few cases are handled that quickly in practice 105 a 2009 u s study found the average age of formal asd diagnosis was 5 7 years far above recommendations and that 27 % of children remained undiagnosed at age 8 years 110
although the symptoms of autism and asd begin early in childhood they are sometimes missed years later adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves to help their employers make adjustments or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits 111
underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases and much of the recent increase in the number of reported asd cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices
the increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose asd resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms
conversely the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis 112
it is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the visually impaired partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes 113</section>
      <section name="management" length="4494" id="13">main article autism therapies a three year old with autism points to fish in an aquarium as part of an experiment on the effect of intensive shared attention training on language development 81
the main goals of treatment are to lessen associated deficits and family distress and to increase quality of life and functional independence
no single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child s needs 9
studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy 114
although many psychosocial interventions have some positive evidence suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment the methodological quality of systematic reviews of these studies has generally been poor their clinical results are mostly tentative and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options 115
intensive sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire self care social and job skills 9 and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors 116 claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated 117 available approaches include applied behavior analysis aba developmental models structured teaching speech and language therapy social skills therapy and occupational therapy 9
educational interventions have some effectiveness in children intensive aba treatment has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing global functioning in preschool children 118 and is well established for improving intellectual performance of young children 116
neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated to educators resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided 106
it is not known whether treatment programs for children lead to significant improvements after the children grow up 116 and the limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results 119
many medications are used to treat asd symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails 14 120
more than half of u s children diagnosed with asd are prescribed psychoactive drugs or anticonvulsants with the most common drug classes being antidepressants stimulants and antipsychotics 121
aside from antipsychotics 122 there is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with asd 123 a person with asd may respond atypically to medications the medications can have adverse effects 9 and no known medication relieves autism s core symptoms of social and communication impairments 124
although many alternative therapies and interventions are available few are supported by scientific studies 21 125 126
treatment approaches have little empirical support in quality of life contexts and many programs focus on success measures that lack predictive validity and real world relevance 22
scientific evidence appears to matter less to service providers than program marketing training availability and parent requests 127
though most alternative treatments such as melatonin have only mild adverse effects 128 some may place the child at risk a 2008 study found that compared to their peers autistic boys have significantly thinner bones if on casein free diets 129 in 2005 botched chelation therapy killed a five year old child with autism 130
treatment is expensive indirect costs are more so
for someone born in 2000 a u s study estimated an average lifetime cost of $3 75 million net present value in 2009 dollars inflation adjusted from 2003 estimate 131 with about 10 % medical care 30 % extra education and other care and 60 % lost economic productivity 132
publicly supported programs are often inadequate or inappropriate for a given child and unreimbursed out of pocket medical or therapy expenses are associated with likelihood of family financial problems 133 one 2008 u s study found a 14% average loss of annual income in families of children with asd 134 and a related study found that asd is associated with higher probability that child care problems will greatly affect parental employment 135
after childhood key treatment issues include residential care job training and placement sexuality social skills and estate planning 126</section>
      <section name="prognosis" length="2130" id="14">there is no known cure 9 children recover occasionally so that they lose their diagnosis of asd 136 this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not
it is not known how often recovery happens 116 reported rates in unselected samples of children with asd have ranged from 3 % to 25 % 136 a few autistic children have acquired speech at age 5 or older 137
most children with autism lack social support meaningful relationships future employment opportunities or self determination 22
although core difficulties tend to persist symptoms often become less severe with age 14 few high quality studies address long term prognosis
some adults show modest improvement in communication skills but a few decline no study has focused on autism after midlife 138
acquiring language before age six having an iq above 50 and having a marketable skill all predict better outcomes independent living is unlikely with severe autism 139
a 2004 british study of 68 adults who were diagnosed before 1980 as autistic children with iq above 50 found that 12 % achieved a high level of independence as adults 10 % had some friends and were generally in work but required some support 19% had some independence but were generally living at home and needed considerable support and supervision in daily living 46 % needed specialist residential provision from facilities specializing in asd with a high level of support and very limited autonomy and 12 % needed high level hospital care 10 a 2005 swedish study of 78 adults that did not exclude low iq found worse prognosis for example only 4 % achieved independence 140
a 2008 canadian study of 48 young adults diagnosed with asd as preschoolers found outcomes ranging through poor 46 % fair 32 % good 17% and very good 4 % 56 % of these young adults had been employed at some point during their lives mostly in volunteer sheltered or part time work 141 changes in diagnostic practice and increased availability of effective early intervention make it unclear whether these findings can be generalized to recently diagnosed children 8</section>
      <section name="epidemiology" length="3335" id="15">main article epidemiology of autism reports of autism cases grew dramatically in the u s from 1996 to 2007 it is unknown how much if any growth came from changes in autism s prevalence

most recent reviews tend to estimate a prevalence of 1–2 per 1 000 for autism and close to 6 per 1 000 for asd 8 because of inadequate data these numbers may underestimate asd s true prevalence 43
pdd nos s prevalence has been estimated at 3 7 per 1 000 asperger s at roughly 0 6 per 1 000 and childhood disintegrative disorder at 0 02 per 1 000 142 the number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the 1990s and early 2000s
this increase is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices referral patterns availability of services age at diagnosis and public awareness 142 143 though unidentified contributing environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out 6 the available evidence does not rule out the possibility that autism s true prevalence has increased 142 a real increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics 61
boys are at higher risk for asd than girls
the sex ratio averages 4 3 1 and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment it may be close to 2 1 with mental retardation and more than 5 5 1 without 8
the risk of autism is also associated with several prenatal and perinatal risk factors
a 2007 review of risk factors found associated parental characteristics that included advanced maternal age advanced paternal age and maternal place of birth outside europe or north america and also found associated obstetric conditions that included low birth weight and gestation duration and hypoxia during childbirth 144
most professionals believe that race ethnicity and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism 145
autism is associated with several other conditions genetic disorders
about 10–15 % of autism cases have an identifiable mendelian single gene condition chromosome abnormality or other genetic syndrome 146 and asd is associated with several genetic disorders 147
mental retardation
the fraction of autistic individuals who also meet criteria for mental retardation has been reported as anywhere from 25 % to 70 % a wide variation illustrating the difficulty of assessing autistic intelligence 148
for asd other than autism the association with mental retardation is much weaker 149
anxiety disorders are common among children with asd there are no firm data but studies have reported prevalences ranging from 11% to 84 %
many anxiety disorders have symptoms that are better explained by asd itself or are hard to distinguish from asd s symptoms 150
epilepsy with variations in risk of epilepsy due to age cognitive level and type of language disorder 151
several metabolic defects such as phenylketonuria are associated with autistic symptoms 76
minor physical anomalies are significantly increased in the autistic population 152
preempted diagnoses
although the dsm iv rules out concurrent diagnosis of many other conditions along with autism the full criteria for adhd tourette syndrome and other of these conditions are often present and these comorbid diagnoses are increasingly accepted 153</section>
      <section name="history" length="3689" id="16">further information history of asperger syndrome and sociological and cultural aspects of autism a few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named
the table talk of martin luther contains the story of a 12 year old boy who may have been severely autistic 154
according to luther s notetaker mathesius luther thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil and suggested that he be suffocated 155
the earliest well documented case of autism is that of hugh blair as detailed in a 1747 court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul blair s marriage to gain blair s inheritance 156
the wild boy of aveyron a feral child caught in 1798 showed several signs of autism the medical student jean itard treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation 157
the new latin word autismus english translation autism was coined by the swiss psychiatrist eugen bleuler in 1910 as he was defining symptoms of schizophrenia
he derived it from the greek word autos αὐτός meaning self and used it to mean morbid self admiration referring to autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance 158
the word autism first took its modern sense in 1938 when hans asperger of the vienna university hospital adopted bleuler s terminology autistic psychopaths in a lecture in german about child psychology 159
asperger was investigating a form of asd now known as asperger syndrome though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981 157 leo kanner of the johns hopkins hospital first used autism in its modern sense in english when he introduced the label early infantile autism in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities 28
almost all the characteristics described in kanner s first paper on the subject notably autistic aloneness and insistence on sameness are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders 57
it is not known whether kanner derived the term independently of asperger 160 kanner s reuse of autism led to decades of confused terminology like infantile schizophrenia and child psychiatry s focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant s response to refrigerator mothers
starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome by demonstrating that it is lifelong distinguishing it from mental retardation and schizophrenia and from other developmental disorders and demonstrating the benefits of involving parents in active programs of therapy 161
as late as the mid 1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism now it is thought to be one of the most heritable of all psychiatric conditions 162
although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood asd have deeply affected how we view asd 157 parents continue to feel social stigma in situations where their autistic children s behaviors are perceived negatively by others 163 and many primary care physicians and medical specialists still express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research 164
the internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find so hard to deal with and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely 165
sociological and cultural aspects of autism have developed some in the community seek a cure while others believe that autism is simply another way of being 11 166</section>

omim 209850 diseasesdb 1142 medlineplus 001526 emedicine med 3202 ped 180 mesh d001321 autism is a brain development disorder characterized by impaired social interaction and communication and by restricted and repetitive behavior
these signs all begin before a child is three years old 1 autism affects many parts of the brain how this occurs is not understood the autism spectrum disorders asd also include the related conditions asperger syndrome and pdd nos which have fewer signs and symptoms 2
autism has a strong genetic basis although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether asd is explained more by multigene interactions or by rare mutations 3
in rare cases autism is strongly associated with agents that cause birth defects 4
controversies surround other proposed environmental causes such as heavy metals pesticides or childhood vaccines 5 the vaccine hypotheses are biologically implausible and lack convincing scientific evidence 6
the prevalence of asd is about 6 per 1 000 people with about four times as many males as females
the number of people known to have autism has increased dramatically since the 1980s partly due to changes in diagnostic practice the question of whether actual prevalence has increased is unresolved 7
parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child s life although early behavioral or cognitive intervention can help children gain self care social and communication skills there is no known cure 8 not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood though some become successful 9
an autistic culture has developed with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be tolerated as a difference and not treated as a disorder 10

      <section name="characteristics" length="733" id="1">autism is a highly variable brain development disorder 11 that first appears during infancy or childhood and generally follows a steady course without remission 12
symptoms tend to continue through adulthood although often in more muted form 13 it is distinguished not by a single symptom but by a characteristic triad of symptoms impairments in social interaction impairments in communication and restricted interests and repetitive behavior
other aspects such as atypical eating are also common but are not essential for diagnosis 14
autism s individual symptoms occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits 15</section>
      <section name="social development" length="2578" id="2">social deficits distinguish autism and the related autism spectrum disorders asd see classification from other developmental disorders 13
people with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted
noted autistic temple grandin described her inability to understand the social communication of neurotypicals or people with normal neural development as leaving her feeling like an anthropologist on mars 16 unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli smile and look at others less often and respond less to their own name autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms for example they have less eye contact and turn taking and are more likely to communicate by manipulating another person s hand 17 three to five year old autistic children are less likely to exhibit social understanding approach others spontaneously imitate and respond to emotions communicate nonverbally and take turns with others
however they do form attachments to their primary caregivers 18
they display moderately less attachment security than usual although this feature disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe asd 19 older children and adults with asd perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition 20
contrary to common beliefs autistic children do not prefer being alone
making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism
for them the quality of friendships not the number of friends predicts how lonely they feel functional friendships such as those resulting in invitations to parties may affect their quality of life more deeply 21
there are many anecdotal reports but few systematic studies of aggression and violence in individuals with asd the limited data suggest that in children with mental retardation autism is associated with aggression destruction of property and tantrums
a 2007 study interviewed parents of 67 children with asd and reported that about two thirds of the children had periods of severe tantrums and about one third had a history of aggression with tantrums significantly more common than in children with a history of language impairment 22
a 2008 swedish study found that of individuals aged 15 or older discharged from hospital with a diagnosis of asd those who committed violent crimes were significantly more likely to have other psychopathological conditions such as psychosis 23</section>
      <section name="communication" length="1701" id="3">about a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs 24
differences in communication may be present from the first year of life and may include delayed onset of babbling unusual gestures diminished responsiveness and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver
in the second and third years autistic children have less frequent and less diverse babbling consonants words and word combinations their gestures are less often integrated with words
autistic children are less likely to make requests or share experiences and are more likely to simply repeat others words echolalia 25 26 or reverse pronouns 27
joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with asd 2 for example they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed at object 17 26 and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience 2
autistic children may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language 25 26
in a pair of studies high functioning autistic children aged 8–15 performed equally well and adults better than individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling
both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language comprehension and inference
as people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends 28</section>
      <section name="repetitive behavior" length="1334" id="4">a young boy with autism and the precise line of toys he made autistic individuals display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior which the repetitive behavior scale revised rbs r 29 categorizes as follows

stereotypy is repetitive movement such as hand flapping making sounds head rolling or body rocking

compulsive behavior is intended and appears to follow rules such as arranging objects in a certain way

sameness is resistance to change for example insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted

ritualistic behavior involves the performance of daily activities the same way each time such as an unvarying menu or dressing ritual
this is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the two factors 30
restricted behavior is limited in focus interest or activity such as preoccupation with a single television program or toy

self injury includes movements that injure or can injure the person such as eye poking skin picking hand biting and head banging 2
a 2007 study reported that self injury at some point affected about 30 % of children with asd 22 no single repetitive behavior seems to be specific to autism but only autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors 29</section>
      <section name="other symptoms" length="2366" id="5">autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis but that can affect the individual or the family 14
an estimated 0 5% to 10 % of individuals with asd show unusual abilities ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants 31
many individuals with asd show superior skills in perception and attention relative to the general population 32
unusual responses to sensory stimuli are more common and prominent in autistic children although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders 33
differences are greater for under responsivity for example walking into things than for over responsivity for example distress from loud noises or for sensation seeking for example rhythmic movements 34
several studies have reported associated motor problems that include poor muscle tone poor motor planning and toe walking asd is not associated with severe motor disturbances 35
unusual eating behavior occurs in about three quarters of children with asd to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator
selectivity is the most common problem although eating rituals and food refusal also occur 22 this does not appear to result in malnutrition
although some children with autism also have gastrointestinal gi symptoms there is a lack of published rigorous data to support the theory that autistic children have more or different gi symptoms than usual 36 studies report conflicting results and the relationship between gi problems and asd is unclear 8
at some point in childhood about two thirds of individuals with asd are affected by sleep problems these most commonly include symptoms of insomnia such as difficulty in falling asleep frequent nocturnal awakenings and early morning awakenings sleep problems are associated with difficult behaviors and family stress and are often a focus of clinical attention over and above the primary asd diagnosis 37
parents of children with asd have higher levels of stress 38
siblings of children with asd report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling siblings of individuals with asd have greater risk of negative well being and poorer sibling relationships as adults 39</section>
      <section name="classification" length="3436" id="6">leo kanner introduced the label early infantile autism in 1943

autism is one of the five pervasive developmental disorders pdd which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior 12
these symptoms do not imply sickness fragility or emotional disturbance 13
of the five pdd forms asperger syndrome is closest to autism in signs and likely causes rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism but may have unrelated causes pdd not otherwise specified pdd nos also called atypical autism is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder 40
unlike autism asperger s has no substantial delay in language development 1
the terminology of autism can be bewildering with autism asperger s and pdd nos often called the autism spectrum disorders asd 8 or sometimes the autistic disorders 41 whereas autism itself is often called autistic disorder childhood autism or infantile autism
in this article autism refers to the classic autistic disorder in clinical practice though autism asd and pdd are often used interchangeably 42
asd in turn is a subset of the broader autism phenotype bap which describes individuals who may not have asd but do have autistic like traits such as avoiding eye contact 43
the manifestations of autism cover a wide spectrum ranging from individuals with severe impairments who may be silent mentally disabled and locked into hand flapping and rocking to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches narrowly focused interests and verbose pedantic communication 44
sometimes the syndrome is divided into low medium or high functioning autism lfa mfa and hfa based on iq thresholds 45 or on how much support the individual requires in daily life these subdivisions are not standardized and are controversial
autism can also be divided into syndromal and non syndromal autism the syndromal autism is associated with severe or profound mental retardation or a congenital syndrome with physical symptoms such as tuberous sclerosis 46
although individuals with asperger s tend to perform better cognitively than those with autism the extent of the overlap between asperger s hfa and non syndromal autism is unclear 47
some studies have reported diagnoses of autism in children due to a loss of language or social skills as opposed to a failure to make progress typically from 15 to 30 months of age
the validity of this distinction remains controversial it is possible that regressive autism is a specific subtype 17 25 48 49 or that there is a continuum of behaviors between autism with and without regression 50
research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subpopulations 51 and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of psychiatry psychology neurology and pediatrics 52
newer technologies such as fmri can help identify biologically relevant phenotypes observable traits that can be viewed on brain scans to help further neurogenetic studies of autism 53
it has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior with the name type 1 autism denoting rare autism cases that test positive for a mutation in the cntnap2 gene 54</section>
      <section name="causes" length="3353" id="7">main article causes of autism it has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic cognitive and neural levels for autism s characteristic triad of symptoms 55
however there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co occur 55 56
deletion 1 duplication 2 and inversion 3 are all chromosome abnormalities that have been implicated in autism 57 autism has a strong genetic basis although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether asd is explained more by multigene interactions or by rare mutations with major effects 3
complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes the environment and epigenetic factors which do not change dna but are heritable and influence gene expression 13
early studies of twins estimated heritability explains more than 90 % of the risk of autism assuming a shared environment and no other genetic or medical syndromes 41
however most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified
typically autism cannot be traced to a mendelian single gene mutation or to a single chromosome abnormality like angelman syndrome or fragile x syndrome and none of the genetic syndromes associated with asds has been shown to selectively cause asd 3 numerous candidate genes have been located with only small effects attributable to any particular gene 3 the large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from copy number variations spontaneous deletions or duplications in genetic material during meiosis 58
hence a substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited that is the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome 57
gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on activity dependent changes and that the symptoms may be reversed or reduced by replacing or modulating gene function after birth 59
all known teratogens agents that cause birth defects related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from conception and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later it is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development 4 although evidence for other environmental causes is anecdotal and has not been confirmed by reliable studies 5 extensive searches are underway 60
environmental factors that have been claimed to contribute to or exacerbate autism or may be important in future research include certain foods infectious disease heavy metals solvents diesel exhaust pcbs phthalates and phenols used in plastic products pesticides brominated flame retardants alcohol smoking illicit drugs vaccines 7 and prenatal stress 61
although parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination and parental concern about vaccines and autism has led to lower rates of childhood immunizations and higher likelihood of measles outbreaks the theories that vaccines cause autism lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible 6</section>
      <section name="mechanism" length="439" id="8">autism s symptoms result from maturation related changes in various systems of the brain 62
despite extensive investigation how autism occurs is not well understood
its mechanism can be divided into two areas the pathophysiology of brain structures and processes associated with autism and the neuropsychological linkages between brain structures and behaviors 62
the behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologies 15</section>
      <section name="pathophysiology" length="6303" id="9">autism affects the amygdala cerebellum and many other parts of the brain 63
unlike many other brain disorders such as parkinson s autism does not have a clear unifying mechanism at either the molecular cellular or systems level it is not known whether autism is a few disorders caused by mutations converging on a few common molecular pathways or is like intellectual disability a large set of disorders with diverse mechanisms 11
autism appears to result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems 64 and to disturb the timing of brain development more than the final product 63
neuroanatomical studies and the associations with teratogens strongly suggest that autism s mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception 4
this anomaly appears to start a cascade of pathological events in the brain that are significantly influenced by environmental factors 65
although many major structures of the human brain have been implicated almost all postmortem studies have been of individuals who also had mental retardation making it difficult to draw conclusions 63
brain weight and volume and head circumference tend to be greater in autistic children 66
the cellular and molecular bases of pathological early overgrowth are not known nor is it known whether the overgrown neural systems cause autism s characteristic signs
current hypotheses include an excess of neurons that causes local overconnectivity in key brain regions 67
disturbed neuronal migration during early gestation 68 69
unbalanced excitatory–inhibitory networks 69
abnormal formation of synapses and dendritic spines 69 for example by modulation of the neurexin–neuroligin cell adhesion system 70 or by poorly regulated synthesis of synaptic protein 71
disrupted synaptic development may also contribute to epilepsy which may explain why the two conditions are associated 72
interactions between the immune system and the nervous system begin early during the embryonic stage of life and successful neurodevelopment depends on a balanced immune response
several symptoms consistent with a poorly regulated immune response have been reported in autistic children
it is possible that aberrant immune activity during critical periods of neurodevelopment is part of the mechanism of some forms of asd 73 as autoantibodies have not been associated with pathology are found in conditions other than asd and are not always present in asd 74 the relationship between immune disturbances and autism remains unclear and controversial 68
several neurotransmitter abnormalities have been detected in autism notably increased blood levels of serotonin
whether these cause structural or behavioral abnormalities is unclear 62
some data suggest an increase in several growth hormones other data argue for diminished growth factors 75
also some inborn errors of metabolism are associated with autism but probably account for less than 5% of cases 76
the mirror neuron system mns theory of autism hypothesizes that distortion in the development of the mns interferes with imitation and leads to autism s core features of social impairment and communication difficulties
the mns operates when an animal performs an action or observes another animal perform the same action
the mns may contribute to an individual s understanding of other people by enabling the modeling of their behavior via embodied simulation of their actions intentions and emotions 77
several studies have tested this hypothesis by demonstrating structural abnormalities in mns regions of individuals with asd delay in the activation in the core circuit for imitation in individuals with asperger s and a correlation between reduced mns activity and severity of the syndrome in children with asd 78 however individuals with autism also have abnormal brain activation in many circuits outside the mns 79 and the mns theory does not explain the normal performance of autistic children on imitation tasks that involve a goal or object 80
autistic individuals tend to use different areas of the brain yellow for a movement task compared to a control group blue
this image was generated by fmri 81 which is used in autism research to measure neural activity 82
asd related patterns of low function and aberrant activation in the brain differ depending on whether the brain is doing social or nonsocial tasks 83
in autism there is evidence for reduced functional connectivity of the default network a large scale brain network involved in social and emotional processing with intact connectivity of the task positive network used in sustained attention and goal directed thinking
in people with autism the two networks are not negatively correlated in time suggesting an imbalance in toggling between the two networks possibly reflecting a disturbance of self referential thought 84
a 2008 brain imaging study found a specific pattern of signals in the cingulate cortex which differs in individuals with asd 85 the underconnectivity theory of autism hypothesizes that autism is marked by underfunctioning high level neural connections and synchronization along with an excess of low level processes 86
evidence for this theory has been found in functional neuroimaging studies on autistic individuals 28 and by a brain wave study that suggested that adults with asd have local overconnectivity in the cortex and weak functional connections between the frontal lobe and the rest of the cortex 87
other evidence suggests the underconnectivity is mainly within each hemisphere of the cortex and that autism is a disorder of the association cortex 88
from studies based on event related potentials transient changes to the brain s electrical activity in response to stimuli there is considerable evidence for differences in autistic individuals with respect to attention orientiation to auditory and visual stimuli novelty detection language and face processing and information storage several studies have found a preference for non social stimuli 89
for example magnetoencephalography studies have found evidence in autistic children of delayed responses in the brain s processing of auditory signals 90</section>
      <section name="neuropsychology" length="2608" id="10">two major categories of cognitive theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behavior

the first category focuses on deficits in social cognition
the empathizing–systemizing theory postulates that autistic individuals can systemize that is they can develop internal rules of operation to handle events inside the brain but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents
an extension the extreme male brain theory hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain defined psychometrically as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing 91 this extension is controversial as many studies contradict the idea that baby boys and girls respond differently to people and objects 92
these theories are related to the earlier theory of mind approach which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others
the theory of mind is supported by autistic children s atypical responses to the sally–anne test for reasoning about others motivations 91 and is mapped well from the mirror neuron system theory of autism 78
the second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing
executive dysfunction hypothesizes that autistic behavior results in part from deficits in working memory planning inhibition and other forms of executive function 93
tests of core executive processes such as eye movement tasks indicate improvement from late childhood to adolescence but performance never reaches typical adult levels 94
a strength of the theory is predicting stereotyped behavior and narrow interests 95 two weaknesses are that executive function is hard to measure 93 and that executive function deficits have not been found in young autistic children 20
weak central coherence theory hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in autism
one strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people 96
a related theory enhanced perceptual functioning focuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and perceptual operations in autistic individuals 97
these theories map well from the underconnectivity theory of autism

neither category is satisfactory on its own social cognition theories poorly address autism s rigid and repetitive behaviors while the nonsocial theories have difficulty explaining social impairment and communication difficulties 56
a combined theory based on multiple deficits may prove to be more useful 98</section>
      <section name="screening" length="1716" id="11">about half of parents of children with asd notice their child s unusual behaviors by age 18 months and about four fifths notice by age 24 months 49
as postponing treatment may affect long term outcome any of the following signs is reason to have a child evaluated by a specialist without delay no babbling by 12 months

no gesturing pointing waving goodbye etc by 12 months

no single words by 16 months

no two word spontaneous phrases other than instances of echolalia by 24 months

any loss of any language or social skills at any age 14 the american academy of pediatrics recommends that all children be screened for asd at the 18 and 24 month well child doctor visits using autism specific formal screening tests 2
in contrast the uk national screening committee recommends against screening for asd in the general population because screening tools have not been fully validated and interventions lack sufficient evidence for effectiveness 99
screening tools include the modified checklist for autism in toddlers m chat the early screening of autistic traits questionnaire and the first year inventory initial data on m chat and its predecessor chat on children aged 18–30 months suggests that it is best used in a clinical setting and that it has low sensitivity many false negatives but good specificity few false positives 49
it may be more accurate to precede these tests with a broadband screener that does not distinguish asd from other developmental disorders 100
screening tools designed for one culture s norms for behaviors like eye contact may be inappropriate for a different culture 101
genetic screening for autism is generally still impractical 102</section>
      <section name="diagnosis" length="4541" id="12">diagnosis is based on behavior not cause or mechanism 15 103
autism is defined in the dsm iv tr as exhibiting at least six symptoms total including at least two symptoms of qualitative impairment in social interaction at least one symptom of qualitative impairment in communication and at least one symptom of restricted and repetitive behavior
sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language and persistent preoccupation with parts of objects
onset must be prior to age three years with delays or abnormal functioning in either social interaction language as used in social communication or symbolic or imaginative play the disturbance must not be better accounted for by rett syndrome or childhood disintegrative disorder 1
icd 10 uses essentially the same definition 12
several diagnostic instruments are available
two are commonly used in autism research the autism diagnostic interview revised adi r is a semistructured parent interview and the autism diagnostic observation schedule ados uses observation and interaction with the child
the childhood autism rating scale cars is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children 17
a pediatrician commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child
if warranted diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from asd specialists observing and assessing cognitive communication family and other factors using standardized tools and taking into account any associated medical conditions 104
a pediatric neuropsychologist is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions 105
a differential diagnosis for asd at this stage might also consider mental retardation hearing impairment and a specific language impairment 104 such as landau–kleffner syndrome 106
clinical genetics evaluations are often done once asd is diagnosed particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause 42
although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated 40 % of cases to genetic causes 107 consensus guidelines in the u s and uk are limited to high resolution chromosome and fragile x testing 42
a genotype first model of diagnosis has been proposed which would routinely assess the genome s copy number variations 108
as new genetic tests are developed several ethical legal and social issues will emerge commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results given the complexity of autism s genetics 102
metabolic and neuroimaging tests are sometimes helpful but are not routine 42 asd can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life for example a one year old who meets diagnostic criteria for asd is less likely than a three year old to continue to do so a few years later 49
in the uk the national autism plan for children recommends at most 30 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment though few cases are handled that quickly in practice 104 a 2009 u s study found the average age of formal asd diagnosis was 5 7 years far above recommendations and that 27 % of children remained undiagnosed at age 8 years 109
although the symptoms of autism and asd begin early in childhood they are sometimes missed years later adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves to help their employers make adjustments or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits 110
underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases and much of the recent increase in the number of reported asd cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices
the increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose asd resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms
conversely the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis 111
it is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the visually impaired partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes 112</section>
      <section name="management" length="4494" id="13">main article autism therapies a three year old with autism points to fish in an aquarium as part of an experiment on the effect of intensive shared attention training on language development 81
the main goals of treatment are to lessen associated deficits and family distress and to increase quality of life and functional independence
no single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child s needs 8
studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy 113
although many psychosocial interventions have some positive evidence suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment the methodological quality of systematic reviews of these studies has generally been poor their clinical results are mostly tentative and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options 114
intensive sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire self care social and job skills 8 and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors 115 claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated 116 available approaches include applied behavior analysis aba developmental models structured teaching speech and language therapy social skills therapy and occupational therapy 8
educational interventions have some effectiveness in children intensive aba treatment has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing global functioning in preschool children 117 and is well established for improving intellectual performance of young children 115
neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated to educators resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided 105
it is not known whether treatment programs for children lead to significant improvements after the children grow up 115 and the limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results 118
many medications are used to treat asd symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails 13 119
more than half of u s children diagnosed with asd are prescribed psychoactive drugs or anticonvulsants with the most common drug classes being antidepressants stimulants and antipsychotics 120
aside from antipsychotics 121 there is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with asd 122 a person with asd may respond atypically to medications the medications can have adverse effects 8 and no known medication relieves autism s core symptoms of social and communication impairments 123
although many alternative therapies and interventions are available few are supported by scientific studies 20 124 125
treatment approaches have little empirical support in quality of life contexts and many programs focus on success measures that lack predictive validity and real world relevance 21
scientific evidence appears to matter less to service providers than program marketing training availability and parent requests 126
though most alternative treatments such as melatonin have only mild adverse effects 127 some may place the child at risk a 2008 study found that compared to their peers autistic boys have significantly thinner bones if on casein free diets 128 in 2005 botched chelation therapy killed a five year old child with autism 129
treatment is expensive indirect costs are more so
for someone born in 2000 a u s study estimated an average lifetime cost of $3 75 million net present value in 2009 dollars inflation adjusted from 2003 estimate 130 with about 10 % medical care 30 % extra education and other care and 60 % lost economic productivity 131
publicly supported programs are often inadequate or inappropriate for a given child and unreimbursed out of pocket medical or therapy expenses are associated with likelihood of family financial problems 132 one 2008 u s study found a 14% average loss of annual income in families of children with asd 133 and a related study found that asd is associated with higher probability that child care problems will greatly affect parental employment 134
after childhood key treatment issues include residential care job training and placement sexuality social skills and estate planning 125</section>
      <section name="prognosis" length="2129" id="14">there is no known cure 8 children recover occasionally so that they lose their diagnosis of asd 135 this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not
it is not known how often recovery happens 115 reported rates in unselected samples of children with asd have ranged from 3 % to 25 % 135 a few autistic children have acquired speech at age 5 or older 136
most children with autism lack social support meaningful relationships future employment opportunities or self determination 21
although core difficulties tend to persist symptoms often become less severe with age 13 few high quality studies address long term prognosis
some adults show modest improvement in communication skills but a few decline no study has focused on autism after midlife 137
acquiring language before age six having an iq above 50 and having a marketable skill all predict better outcomes independent living is unlikely with severe autism 138
a 2004 british study of 68 adults who were diagnosed before 1980 as autistic children with iq above 50 found that 12 % achieved a high level of independence as adults 10 % had some friends and were generally in work but required some support 19% had some independence but were generally living at home and needed considerable support and supervision in daily living 46 % needed specialist residential provision from facilities specializing in asd with a high level of support and very limited autonomy and 12 % needed high level hospital care 9 a 2005 swedish study of 78 adults that did not exclude low iq found worse prognosis for example only 4 % achieved independence 139
a 2008 canadian study of 48 young adults diagnosed with asd as preschoolers found outcomes ranging through poor 46 % fair 32 % good 17% and very good 4 % 56 % of these young adults had been employed at some point during their lives mostly in volunteer sheltered or part time work 140 changes in diagnostic practice and increased availability of effective early intervention make it unclear whether these findings can be generalized to recently diagnosed children 7</section>
      <section name="epidemiology" length="3335" id="15">main article epidemiology of autism reports of autism cases grew dramatically in the u s from 1996 to 2007 it is unknown how much if any growth came from changes in autism s prevalence

most recent reviews tend to estimate a prevalence of 1–2 per 1 000 for autism and close to 6 per 1 000 for asd 7 because of inadequate data these numbers may underestimate asd s true prevalence 42
pdd nos s prevalence has been estimated at 3 7 per 1 000 asperger s at roughly 0 6 per 1 000 and childhood disintegrative disorder at 0 02 per 1 000 141 the number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the 1990s and early 2000s
this increase is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices referral patterns availability of services age at diagnosis and public awareness 141 142 though unidentified contributing environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out 5 the available evidence does not rule out the possibility that autism s true prevalence has increased 141 a real increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics 60
boys are at higher risk for asd than girls
the sex ratio averages 4 3 1 and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment it may be close to 2 1 with mental retardation and more than 5 5 1 without 7
the risk of autism is also associated with several prenatal and perinatal risk factors
a 2007 review of risk factors found associated parental characteristics that included advanced maternal age advanced paternal age and maternal place of birth outside europe or north america and also found associated obstetric conditions that included low birth weight and gestation duration and hypoxia during childbirth 143
most professionals believe that race ethnicity and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism 144
autism is associated with several other conditions genetic disorders
about 10–15 % of autism cases have an identifiable mendelian single gene condition chromosome abnormality or other genetic syndrome 145 and asd is associated with several genetic disorders 146
mental retardation
the fraction of autistic individuals who also meet criteria for mental retardation has been reported as anywhere from 25 % to 70 % a wide variation illustrating the difficulty of assessing autistic intelligence 147
for asd other than autism the association with mental retardation is much weaker 148
anxiety disorders are common among children with asd there are no firm data but studies have reported prevalences ranging from 11% to 84 %
many anxiety disorders have symptoms that are better explained by asd itself or are hard to distinguish from asd s symptoms 149
epilepsy with variations in risk of epilepsy due to age cognitive level and type of language disorder 150
several metabolic defects such as phenylketonuria are associated with autistic symptoms 76
minor physical anomalies are significantly increased in the autistic population 151
preempted diagnoses
although the dsm iv rules out concurrent diagnosis of many other conditions along with autism the full criteria for adhd tourette syndrome and other of these conditions are often present and these comorbid diagnoses are increasingly accepted 152</section>
      <section name="history" length="3689" id="16">further information history of asperger syndrome and sociological and cultural aspects of autism a few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named
the table talk of martin luther contains the story of a 12 year old boy who may have been severely autistic 153
according to luther s notetaker mathesius luther thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil and suggested that he be suffocated 154
the earliest well documented case of autism is that of hugh blair as detailed in a 1747 court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul blair s marriage to gain blair s inheritance 155
the wild boy of aveyron a feral child caught in 1798 showed several signs of autism the medical student jean itard treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation 156
the new latin word autismus english translation autism was coined by the swiss psychiatrist eugen bleuler in 1910 as he was defining symptoms of schizophrenia
he derived it from the greek word autos αὐτός meaning self and used it to mean morbid self admiration referring to autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance 157
the word autism first took its modern sense in 1938 when hans asperger of the vienna university hospital adopted bleuler s terminology autistic psychopaths in a lecture in german about child psychology 158
asperger was investigating a form of asd now known as asperger syndrome though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981 156 leo kanner of the johns hopkins hospital first used autism in its modern sense in english when he introduced the label early infantile autism in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities 27
almost all the characteristics described in kanner s first paper on the subject notably autistic aloneness and insistence on sameness are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders 56
it is not known whether kanner derived the term independently of asperger 159 kanner s reuse of autism led to decades of confused terminology like infantile schizophrenia and child psychiatry s focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant s response to refrigerator mothers
starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome by demonstrating that it is lifelong distinguishing it from mental retardation and schizophrenia and from other developmental disorders and demonstrating the benefits of involving parents in active programs of therapy 160
as late as the mid 1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism now it is thought to be one of the most heritable of all psychiatric conditions 161
although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood asd have deeply affected how we view asd 156 parents continue to feel social stigma in situations where their autistic children s behaviors are perceived negatively by others 162 and many primary care physicians and medical specialists still express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research 163
the internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find so hard to deal with and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely 164
sociological and cultural aspects of autism have developed some in the community seek a cure while others believe that autism is simply another way of being 10 165</section>
