omim 209850 diseasesdb 1142 medlineplus 001526 emedicine med 3202 ped 180 mesh d001321 autism is a brain development disorder characterized by impaired social interaction and communication and by restricted and repetitive behavior
these signs all begin before a child is three years old 1 autism affects many parts of the brain how this occurs is not understood 2 the autism spectrum-disorders asd also include the related conditions asperger syndrome and pdd nos which have fewer signs and symptoms 3
autism has a strong genetic basis although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether asd is explained more by multigene interactions or by rare mutations 4
in rare cases autism is strongly associated with agents that cause birth defects 5
controversies surround other proposed environmental causes such as heavy metals pesticides or childhood vaccines 6 the vaccine hypotheses are biologically implausible and lack convincing scientific evidence 7
the prevalence of asd is about 6 per 1 000 people with about four times as many males as females
the number of people known to have autism has increased dramatically since the 1980s partly due to changes in diagnostic practice the question of whether actual prevalence has increased is unresolved 8
parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child s life although early behavioral or cognitive intervention can help children gain self care social and communication skills there is no known cure 9 not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood though some become successful 10
an autistic culture has developed with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be tolerated as a difference and not treated as a disorder 11

autism is a highly variable brain development disorder 12 that first appears during infancy or childhood and generally follows a steady course without remission 13
symptoms tend to continue through adulthood although often in more muted form 14 it is distinguished not by a single symptom but by a characteristic triad of symptoms impairments in social interaction impairments in communication and restricted interests and repetitive behavior
other aspects such as atypical eating are also common but are not essential for diagnosis 15
autism s individual symptoms occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits 16
